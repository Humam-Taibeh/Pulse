src/utils/updater.py

THE SELF-UPDATER (v10.3) — check, verify, then hand over.

Pulse is a system-repair tool that elevates ~24 of its tasks. An updater
for it is therefore a security component first and a convenience second,
and the whole module is arranged around one rule:

    NOTHING DOWNLOADED IS EVER EXECUTED UNTIL ITS SHA-256 MATCHES A DIGEST
    PUBLISHED IN THE RELEASE.

A tool that runs elevated code, downloading an installer over the network
and launching it, is exactly the shape of a supply-chain compromise. HTTPS
alone does not close that: it authenticates the host, not the artifact, and
it says nothing about a release asset replaced after publication. So
tools/build_release.ps1 emits SHA256SUMS beside the installer, the release
publishes both, and verify() refuses anything that does not match. A
release without SHA256SUMS is a release this updater declines — silently
and correctly.

EVERY NETWORK FAILURE IS SILENT
    check() returns None for offline, DNS failure, timeout, HTTP 403 (the
    unauthenticated GitHub API allows 60 requests/hour/IP), malformed JSON,
    a missing asset, anything. This is not defensive habit: Pulse routinely
    runs on machines that are broken, freshly imaged, behind a captive
    portal or deliberately offline. An update check that produces an error
    the user has to dismiss would be a worse bug than never checking.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
    No Qt. It is pure logic — network, parsing, comparison, hashing — so
    every rule above is testable without a GUI, an event loop or a
    display. The dialog and the QThread that drives it live in the
    frontend; this is what they call.

    No `requests`. requirements.txt is one line (PySide6) and stays that
    way: urllib does a JSON GET and a streamed download perfectly well,
    and ssl.create_default_context() already validates against the Windows
    certificate store.
