Shared utilities for the Pulse GUI:

  - PowerShellTask / TaskResult : runs core.ps1 in a background QThread and
    reports back to the GUI thread ONLY through Qt signals. This is the fix
    for the main correctness bug in the previous version, which mutated
    QLabel/QProgressBar widgets directly from a raw Python `threading.Thread`.
    Qt widgets are not thread-safe - touching them from any thread other
    than the GUI thread is undefined behaviour (works "most of the time",
    then crashes or silently corrupts the UI under load). QThread + Signal
    marshals the result back onto the GUI thread automatically.

  - Toast / ToastManager : glass-morphism toast notifications that slide in
    from the top-right corner and auto-dismiss, matching the "VS Code /
    macOS" style requested.

  - prefs (sibling module) : the durable QSettings-backed preferences.

(HoverGlow / PulseAnimation were removed in v10 — both were superseded by
frontend/animations.py's effect-free painted equivalents years of refactors
ago and had zero call sites left.)

    """Emit `signal`, tolerating a source object that is already deleted.

    WHY THIS EXISTS: EMITTING INTO A DELETED OBJECT ABORTS THE PROCESS.

    A worker's run() executes on its own thread. The owner that created it
    lives on the GUI thread and can be destroyed while that run() is still
    unwinding: PulseDialog.done() settles worker threads precisely to stop
    that, but the settle has a deadline (_WORKER_WAIT_MS), and two of the
    worker dialogs deliberately let a mutation finish rather than kill it.
    Past that deadline the C++ QObject is gone while the Python frame is
    still running.

    `self.finished.emit(...)` then raises RuntimeError("Signal source has
    been deleted"). That exception is on a NON-MAIN thread, inside a slot
    PySide6 invoked, so it has nowhere to go: PySide6 treats an unhandled
    exception in a slot as fatal, and the process dies with 0xC0000409
    (STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN) - no traceback, no Qt warning, and a
    test session whose every assertion passed exits non-zero with its
    summary line missing. That is not a hypothetical: it is how this was
    found, first on a CI runner and then reproducibly once deleting the
    ambient field removed ~150-360ms of deferral from each page
    transition and let dialogs be destroyed sooner.

    Swallowing the RuntimeError is correct rather than merely convenient.
    A signal has exactly one purpose - to tell an owner something - and
    the owner is gone. There is nobody left to inform and nothing left to
    do. Returns False when the emit was dropped, so a caller that wants to
    stop early can.

# ============================================================
#  WINDOWS JOB OBJECT  (v10.2 — the kill guarantee)
# ============================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Stopping a task used to mean `taskkill /T /F` on powershell.exe's PID.
#   /T walks the parent-child tree at the moment it runs, which misses the
#   processes that matter most: winget hands work to an elevation broker,
#   MSI packages hand off to the machine-wide msiexec service, and both are
#   REPARENTED away from our tree. The orphan then survives the kill and
#   keeps the inherited stdout pipe open, so the read loop never sees EOF
#   and the task hangs until its watchdog fires.
#
#   A Job Object is the kernel's own answer: membership is inherited by
#   every descendant and cannot be escaped by reparenting, so terminating
#   the job kills the whole set atomically, whatever it re-parented to.
#
# THE DANGEROUS PART, AND WHY THE KILL FLAG IS CLEARED ON SUCCESS
#   JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE kills every member the instant the
#   last handle closes. That is exactly right for a crash or a cancel, and
#   catastrophic on a normal finish — because several tasks END by
#   launching something the user is meant to keep using:
#       CleanCache          -> cleanmgr.exe, "follow its on-screen prompts"
#       ClassicContextMenu  -> Start-Process explorer  (the desktop shell!)
#       StartupReport       -> taskmgr.exe
#       several catalogs    -> the user's browser / the Store
#   Killing the job on a successful run would close Disk Cleanup the
#   moment it appeared and take the user's Explorer session with it.
#
#   So the flag is CLEARED before the handle is closed on the success path
#   (detach()), and TerminateJobObject is called only when the user
#   cancelled, the watchdog fired, or the reader died. The safety net stays
#   armed for every abnormal exit, including the GUI being killed outright:
#   the OS closes our handles, and the leftover tree dies with them.

            most download pages produce, so `Adobe’s Reader.exe` is an
            ordinary filename, not a crafted one — therefore CLOSED the
            literal early. Benignly that produced a parse error the GUI
            reported as "Script finished without a recognized status line";
            deliberately it appended arbitrary PowerShell, running with
            whatever rights Pulse had, elevation included.

            No escape table fixes this class of bug, because the bug is
            that a command string is re-parsed at all. -File takes the
            script and its parameters as argv entries that PowerShell binds
            directly, so a value is never tokenized and quoting stops being
            a thing that can be got wrong. validate_backend_arg covers the
            two things argv genuinely cannot express (see its docstring).

            The dropped "[Console]::OutputEncoding = UTF8;" prefix is not a
            loss: core.ps1 sets exactly that itself, before it loads a
            single module (see its own comment), so the pipe was always
            being configured twice.
