USER PREFERENCES — the app's small, durable memory (v10).

Before this, Pulse remembered nothing between launches: it always opened
dark, always at the default size in the middle of the primary monitor, and
always with the Activity drawer unpinned, no matter what the user had
chosen last time. Every session started by undoing the previous one.

Backed by QSettings, so storage is the platform-native location
(HKCU\\Software\\HumamTaibeh\\Pulse on Windows) with no file handling,
no serialisation format to maintain, and no risk of a corrupt file
breaking startup — every getter degrades to its default.

Deliberately NOT stored here: anything the backend owns (applied tweak
state is read live from the system by GetTweakState, never cached, so the
GUI can't disagree with reality after a change made outside Pulse).

# Task history answers "when did I last run THIS card, and how long does

# card's "Ran 3d ago · ~2m" caption and its ACTION DUE badge.
#
# A second store used to sit beside it: an ordered, three-deep "recent
# operations" trail feeding the sidebar's RECENT panel. The panel was cut
# in the v1.0 RC layout pass (see main.PulseApp._build_ui) and the trail
# went with it — nothing read it, and a store nothing reads is a schema
# the next version still has to migrate.
#
# The bound is defensive rather than functional — there are 38 tasks, so
# the map is tiny. It only matters across versions, where a renamed or
# dropped task would otherwise leave a record nothing ever reads again.

HISTORY_RUNS_WEIGHT = 5

#: A duration above this did not happen, and is refused rather than
#: averaged (see record_task_run).
#:
#: THE CASE IS A SUSPENDED MACHINE. A task in flight when the lid closes
#: resumes with an elapsed time measured across the sleep, and that value
#: goes into an exponential moving average which is PERSISTED - so one
#: overnight suspend makes a card advertise a typical duration of several
#: hours, and the EMA's memory keeps it advertising it for many runs
#: after. The existing `duration_ms <= 0` guard covers a clock that went
#: backwards; nothing covered one that jumped forward.
#:
#: DECIDABLE BECAUSE OF THE WATCHDOG: every task is killed at its own
#: timeout (helpers.PowerShellTask), and the largest configured anywhere
#: is 3600s, so no genuine run can exceed that. Two hours leaves a full
#: hour of headroom above the longest possible task while still catching
#: any suspend worth noticing.
#:
#: Deliberately phrased as "implausible", not "asleep": the same guard
#: covers a VM snapshot restore, a hibernation and a debugger pause, and
#: it needs to know which one happened no more than it needs to know what
#: time.monotonic() does across S3 - which, resolving to
#: QueryPerformanceCounter here, is not something the suite can test
#: without suspending the machine running it.
