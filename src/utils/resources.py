WHERE PULSE'S FILES LIVE (v10.3).

Pulse runs from three different layouts and has to find the same files in
all of them:

    a source checkout      repo/src/backend/core.ps1
    a PyInstaller bundle   <_MEIPASS>/src/backend/core.ps1
    an installed exe       <exe dir>/playbooks/*.json

Before this module, three separate functions each re-derived that ladder
from their own `__file__` — main._locate_ps1, main._locate_icon and
playbooks.playbook_dirs — and a fourth pattern (the user's Desktop) was
recomputed inline in three places. Four answers to two questions, none of
them wrong yet, all of them free to drift apart the next time the layout
changed.

TWO ROOT SETS, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS
    `bundled_roots()` is what SHIPS with Pulse: the bundle's extraction
    directory and the source tree. `user_roots()` is that plus the
    directory the executable sits in, which a technician can write to.

    Those are deliberately not the same list, and the split is a security
    boundary rather than a tidiness one. Playbooks are meant to be
    user-extensible — dropping `workstation-standard.json` next to the exe
    is a supported workflow — so they search `user_roots()`. The ENGINE
    (core.ps1) does not: letting a file beside the executable win the
    lookup would mean anyone who can write to the install directory can
    replace the script Pulse runs, elevated, on every task. That is the
    same class of hijack the v10.3 pass closed for `powershell.exe` and
    the working directory, and it would be an odd thing to re-open here.

    FROZEN BUILDS RETURN THE BUNDLE AND NOTHING ELSE (v1.0), and that is a
    security fix rather than a tidy-up. REPO_ROOT and SRC_DIR are derived
    from this module's own __file__, which inside a PyInstaller bundle is a
    synthetic path under the extraction directory — so in a ONEFILE build,
    where _MEIPASS is `%TEMP%\\_MEIxxxxxx`, the ladder resolved to:

        SRC_DIR   = %TEMP%\\_MEIxxxxxx
        REPO_ROOT = %TEMP%              <-- user-writable, and a "bundled" root

    promises to hold: `%TEMP%\\src\\backend\\core.ps1` became a fallback
    location for the elevated engine, and because resource_dirs() merges
    every match rather than stopping at the first, `%TEMP%\\playbooks\\*.json`
    joined the playbook list outright. Any process running as the user could
    write both.

    The source-checkout ladder is only meaningful when there IS a checkout,
    so it is now scoped to exactly that case.
