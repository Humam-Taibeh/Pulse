THE VERSION, AND THERE IS EXACTLY ONE OF IT (v10.3).

Pulse's version used to be a literal, copied. `APP_VERSION` sat in
main.py, `$Script:ScriptVersion` in core.ps1, and each carried a comment
asking the next person to keep them in lockstep. They drifted anyway —
both were pinned at 10.0 through the 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 releases, so the
title bar, the sidebar footer and QApplication all reported a version no
changelog entry matched. tests/test_contract.py has caught that pair since,
but a test that compares two literals only proves they are equal; it does
not stop a third from being added.

Three more were about to be: the Inno Setup script names the output
`PULSE_Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe`, the PyInstaller spec stamps a Windows version
resource onto the exe, and the updater compares the running build against
a GitHub tag. Five copies of one fact, four of which the app cannot read
at runtime.

So the fact moved OUT of the code entirely, into `VERSION` at the repo
root — a file the GUI imports, PowerShell reads, Inno Setup preprocesses
and CI tags from. Nothing computes it; everything quotes it.

WHY A FALLBACK EXISTS
    `VERSION` ships inside the bundle (see main.spec's datas). If it is
    ever missing — a hand-assembled build, a partial copy — the honest
    options are to crash or to be approximately right about a decoration.
    Every other getter in utils/ takes the second (see prefs.py's "any
    corruption yields an empty map"), because a version string is used in
    a badge, a footer and an update check, and none of those is worth
    refusing to start over. The fallback is deliberately the same literal
    the file holds, and test_contract.py pins them together so it cannot
    quietly rot into a lie.

THE THREE-COMPONENT SCHEME
    Tags are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. That is not cosmetic: the updater
    compares versions as integer tuples, and the repo's own history shows
    why the components have to be normalised before they are compared —
    the existing tags are `v1.0.0` and `v6.1.0` (three) while the app
    reported `10.3` (two). String comparison gets `"10.3" < "6.1.0"`
    exactly backwards and would have offered users a downgrade.

    NORMALISED TO THREE COMPONENTS, which is the entire point. The
    comparison this feeds decides whether a user is offered an update, and
    the two mistakes available here both ship a downgrade:

        "10.3" < "6.1.0"        as strings  -> offers v6.1.0 over 10.3.0
        (10, 3) > (10, 3, 0)    ragged tuples -> never offers 10.3.1

    Missing components are zero-filled; extra ones are dropped; anything
    non-numeric ends the parse rather than raising, so a tag like
    `v11.0.0-rc1` compares as `(11, 0, 0)` instead of throwing inside a
    background update check. An unparseable string is `(0, 0, 0)` — the
    version that can never win a comparison, so a malformed tag is
    silently ignored rather than acted on.
