Pulse — GUI orchestrator (PySide6).

MODULAR BLUEPRINT (v6)
======================
    menu_structure.py   data      — categories, cards, task IDs, timeouts
    theme.py            design    — dual-theme tokens, QSS factories, DWM glass
    animations.py       motion    — glow, shimmer, cascade, page fade (60 fps)
    widgets.py          components— TitleBar, NavButton, GlassCard, ConfirmDialog
    utils/helpers.py    threading — PowerShellTask worker, ToastManager
    main.py (this)      orchestration ONLY — pages, navigation, task pipeline

Runtime guarantees:
    - Qt widgets touched only from the GUI thread; PowerShell runs on a
      QThread and reports back through signals.
    - One task at a time; extra clicks get an info toast.
    - No QGraphicsEffect in steady state, no setStyleSheet() in timers —
      see animations.py for the performance doctrine.
    - Theme switches live via ThemeManager.changed -> _apply_theme(t).

    FOUR ELEMENTS, AND THE MIDDLE TWO ARE THE PAGE. The QUICK ACTIONS band
    is still the centerpiece and still NOT a repeat of the sidebar: the
    left rail navigates modules, so duplicating them here as a grid would
    be redundant. Instead the dashboard surfaces the highest-value single
    OPERATIONS as live cards that RUN on click (action_requested).

    v15 PUTS A HEALTH ROW BACK ABOVE THEM, and it is worth saying why,
    because the v1.0 RC pass deliberately deleted one. What it removed was
    a 210px band — a telemetry ribbon, a System Pulse meter card and a
    Maintenance & Attention list — that between them restated facts the
    Health Report and the cards' own ACTION DUE badges already carried,
    and cost a third of the canvas to do it. Everything that critique said
    is still true, and none of it argues for the empty page it left:
    with six short cards centred in a void, the dashboard read as a view
    that had failed to finish loading.

    So the band comes back at a QUARTER of the height and answers only
    what nothing else on this screen can:

      * CPU / MEMORY / STORAGE are the machine's live state, and a
        launcher for maintenance operations that cannot tell you whether
        the machine needs maintenance is missing its own premise. As four
        figures with meters they cost ~84px, against the 158px two cards
        of meter bars used to.
      * ACTIONS DUE is the count of badged, overdue operations ACROSS
        EVERY MODULE — which is precisely the fact the old "Maintenance &
        Attention" list was criticised for duplicating per-card, stated
        once instead of enumerated. It is the number that decides whether
        to open a module at all.

    The status line beneath the actions keeps the machine's static
    identity and gains the SESSION's: whether Pulse is elevated and
    whether the engine is present. Those two facts used to be a pair of
    outlined pills crowding the masthead's right edge, where they competed
    with the wordmark for the top of the page; as a caption on the footer
    rule they sit with the other things that are true of this run.

    #: Narrowest a Quick Action card may be laid out at, and therefore what
    #: decides the column count (see _columns_for).
    #:
    #: v1.0 RC: 250 -> 224, and the number is DERIVED, not tuned by eye. At
    #: the app's own default window (1180px) the content viewport is 754px,
    #: which with 24px gutters gives three columns only while the unit is
    #: <= 240. At 250 it resolved to TWO — six cards became three rows,
    #: 473px of grid inside a 413px viewport, and the dashboard scrolled at
    #: the size it opens at. A launcher whose six actions do not fit on the
    #: default window is not a launcher. 224 leaves margin below the 240
    #: ceiling (three columns hold from ~1130px wide) and stays well clear
    #: of the 192px the card's own content actually needs, so nothing is
    #: squeezed to buy the extra column. The app's MINIMUM window still
    #: resolves to two columns and scrolls, which is correct: at 620px tall
    #: no arrangement of six cards fits, and scrolling beats crushing.
    ACTION_MIN_W = 224
    #: v15.1 RETURNS IT TO 3, and the reason the v14 value existed is the
    #: reason it can now go: it was 6 because "three columns stretch each
    #: quick action past 500px from about 1440p up, and the dashboard
    #: reads as six placards instead of a launcher". True of the width
    #: alone, and answered by making each card wider rather than by
    #: doubling how many there are: six across at 2560px maximised gave a
    #: 340px card whose own title wrapped to two lines, which is the
    #: crowded half of the very same defect.
    #:
    #: 2x3 IS THE COMPOSITION, at every width the app can be opened at,
    #: and stating it is the whole job this constant does.
    #:
    #: A CONTENT MEASURE WAS TRIED HERE AND REMOVED, which is worth
    #: recording because it is the obvious second fix and it is the wrong
    #: one. Capping the dashboard's column at 3 x 416 + gutters and
    #: centring it does stop the crowding — and it re-introduces, at
    #: exactly the window sizes this app is used at, the defect the page
    #: padding was just unified to remove: the column jumps sideways when
    #: you open a module, because a category page still fills the width
    #: and the dashboard no longer does. Rendered side by side at 2200px
    #: the capped version also simply looks worse: a dense block of cards
    #: with 400px of empty canvas either side, inside a bordered frame
    #: that goes all the way to the edge.
    #:
    #: Three columns filling the width is what the rest of the app does,
    #: and at 2200px it lands each action at ~530px — wide, but a card
    #: whose description is one short line does not suffer for it, and
    #: nothing wraps.

    #: Ceiling on the air between the health band and the QUICK ACTIONS
    #: header — see the note where it is spent.
    #:
    #: v15.1: one clean section break, down from a section break PLUS a
    #: card gutter (56px). The larger figure was solved when this stretch
    #: was the only thing standing between the masthead and a header 190px
    #: below it, and it had to be generous or the page read as unfinished.
    #: With the health band occupying that slot the stretch stopped holding
    #: the page together and went back to being what it is named for: the
    #: step between two sibling sections, which is SPACE["xxl"] everywhere
    #: else in the app.

    #: Width the masthead tagline may ask for before it starts eliding.
    #: MEASURED as the natural width of the tagline set below, at the
    #: `tagline` type role and including its 1px letter-spacing, so the
    #: line renders in full on any window with room for it and degrades to
    #: an ellipsis only once the masthead is genuinely squeezed.
    #:
    #: RE-MEASURE THIS WHENEVER THE TAGLINE TEXT CHANGES, and measure it
    #: off the LIVE, POLISHED widget — a QLabel's font-size arrives from
    #: QSS during polish, so QFontMetrics(label.font()) before that reads
    #: the default type size and under-reports (the same polish-timing trap
    #: ClampedLabel.changeEvent documents). "Windows Orchestration Toolkit"
    #: measures 191px live and 234px if measured wrong.
    #:
    #: It was 260 for the previous, longer "Enterprise-Grade Windows

        # the pair is centred between two stretches rather than pinned to
        # the top.
        #
        # Both halves of that are load-bearing. Removing the 210px health
        # band left the six cards top-anchored above a half-canvas void,
        # which reads as a page that failed to finish loading rather than
        # as breathing room. Centring the block turns the same emptiness
        # into margin. And the header has to ride WITH the grid to do it —
        # centring the grid alone would have stranded "QUICK ACTIONS" at
        # the top of the scroll area, a section title floating 200px above
        # the section it names, which is exactly the proximity failure the
        # category pages' band headers are tested against.

        # every canvas height.
        #
        # The rule this replaces was 1:2 — a third of the air above the
        # block, two thirds below — chosen because true centring puts ~200px
        # between the masthead and the section it introduces, and a gap that
        # size reads as a missing element rather than as margin: the eye
        # looks for what used to be there. But a PROPORTION cannot hold a
        # gap; it only holds a ratio. The moment v14's column ceiling let
        # the six actions collapse from two rows to one, the block lost
        # ~180px of its own height, a third of that went straight back into
        # the top gap, and the ratio dutifully reproduced the exact ~190px
        # void it was introduced to prevent.
        #
        # Stated as a bound instead, it cannot drift: the air above grows
        # with the canvas up to a section break's worth and then stops, so
        # the header stays with the masthead at every size, and everything
        # left over falls below the last card — where it is the page's
        # bottom margin, closed by the footer rule.
        # ---- SYSTEM HEALTH: the KPI row --------------------------------
        # It sits FIRST, directly under the masthead and hard against it.
        # A dashboard's state belongs above its controls: you read what the
        # machine is doing, then decide what to do about it, and reversing
        # that order turns the health row into a footnote under the thing
        # it is supposed to inform.
        #
        # It also does the job the centring stretch below used to be doing
        # on its own. That stretch exists because deleting the old health
        # band left ~190px of nothing between the masthead and the section
        # header, and a gap that size reads as a missing element rather
        # than as margin — the eye looks for what used to be there. With
        # a real band back in the slot, the stretch is no longer holding

    it back or the content hangs off all four monitor edges and over the
    taskbar.

    THIS REPLACES AN IsZoomed() TEST THAT NEVER FIRED. The old code insets
    by resize_border_thickness() when IsZoomed() reports maximized — but
    IsZoomed() reads the WS_MAXIMIZE style, and this message is part of the

    GetWindowPlacement().showCmd was measured too and is stale in exactly
    the same way, so swapping probes fixes nothing.

    Clamping needs no state at all, which is why it is used instead. It is
    also self-correcting where a blind inset was not: when Windows proposes
    exactly the work area — which is what Qt's maximize path produces here,

        The dialog itself (PulseDialog) sizes to the shell body and paints

        so the card grid / console underneath is fully masked and a click
        on the backdrop dismisses the dialog, with no separate scrim widget
        to coordinate here.

        THE deleteLater IS THE POINT OF THIS BEING A FUNNEL. Every modal in
        the app is built as `SomeDialog(self, ...)` — parented to the
        window — and then dropped on the floor when the local goes out of
        scope. A parented QWidget does not care: the C++ object belongs to
        PulseApp and lives until PulseApp does, so each modal survived
        until the app was closed.
        Measured: ten Ctrl+K presses left ten live CommandPalettes holding
        120 list rows and 970 child QObjects between them, and every one of
        the twenty-two call sites through here had the same shape. The
        palette is the app's primary navigation surface, so "dozens per
        session" is the ordinary case rather than the pathological one.

        Deferred deletion is what makes this safe to do here rather than at
        each call site: deleteLater posts a DeferredDelete event for the
        next event-loop turn, while every caller reads what it needs
        (`palette.chosen_item`, `dialog.selected_ids`, `wizard.result`)
        synchronously on the line after this returns. The object is fully
        alive for all of them.

        The one modal NOT covered is the playbook's run-mode dialog, which
        deliberately calls dialog.exec() itself: it is wired to a runner's
        signals that can still arrive after exec() returns, so its lifetime
        belongs to the run rather than to this call.

             has always had.
          3. only if it is STILL running: disconnect every signal so a late
             `emit` cannot reach this dying window, and un-parent the
             thread so Qt does not destroy a running QThread when the

           edge/corner resizing uses real cursors, the OS size loop,
           min-size clamping and snap behavior. Everything inside stays
           HTCLIENT. A maximized window has no resize border, matching
           native apps — which also means the caption zones then reach
           the literal top-right screen corner (Fitts corner-slam close).
        2. Non-client caption buttons: WM_NCHITTEST maps generously
           expanded zones over minimize/maximize/close to HTMINBUTTON /
           HTMAXBUTTON / HTCLOSEBUTTON, so a click anywhere in the
           top-right corner region lands — no pixel-perfect aiming.
           HTMAXBUTTON additionally summons the Windows 11 Snap Layouts
           flyout. Windows owns those buttons' mouse events from then on:
           hover is mirrored via titlebar.set_nc_hover() and clicks are
           re-injected from WM_NCLBUTTONUP (the sequence Microsoft's own
