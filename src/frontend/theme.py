DESIGN SYSTEM — Apple-level Glassmorphism, dual theme (Premium Dark / Clean Light).

This module owns every color, every QSS string and the theme switcher.
Nothing here imports widgets or main — it is a pure leaf dependency:

    theme.py  <-  animations.py  <-  widgets.py  <-  main.py

Public surface:
    ThemeManager        live theme state + `changed` signal (no restart needed)
    tokens("dark")      raw token dict for a mode
    alpha("#00d4ff",x)  hex -> rgba() with opacity
    *_qss(t, ...)       QSS factory functions, each takes a token dict
    apply_native_rounding() / enable_native_sizing_frame()
                        DWM corner + Win32 frame integration (Windows, ctypes only)

Rules:
    - QSS is built ONCE per theme switch and applied per widget class.
      Never rebuild stylesheets inside timers/animations (style re-polish
      is the most expensive repeated operation in Qt).
    - Continuous animation colors come from tokens too — animations.py
      reads them, paints them; it never touches QSS.

# ============================================================
#  SPACING & RADIUS SCALE (v10)
# ============================================================
# Before v10 the codebase used 13 distinct setSpacing() values (2,4,7,8,9,
# 10,12,13,14,15,16,20) and 17 distinct border-radius values, with margins
# like (15,13,16,13) and (30,18,30,20) that read as accidents rather than
# decisions — the root cause of the app's "almost aligned" feel. Everything
# now comes from these two scales; a new surface picks the nearest step
# instead of inventing another number.
#
# v1.1 closes the scale at both ends. The audit that prompted it found 57
# layout calls still carrying hand-picked numbers (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10,
# 14, 18, 20, 28, 30, 34) — every one of them within 2px of a step, which
# is exactly the "almost aligned" feel the scale was introduced to kill.
# Two of those clusters were real needs the five steps could not express,
# so they became steps rather than staying exceptions: the 1-3px leading
# between two lines of ONE text block (a title and its subtitle are not
# "related blocks"), and the 28-34px air a dialog puts around an empty
# state. Everything else now snaps to the nearest existing step.
SPACE = {
    "xxs": 2,    # leading INSIDE one text block (title over subtitle)
    "xs":  4,    # icon<->label, tight inline pairs
    "sm":  8,    # inside a row / between sibling controls
    "md":  12,   # between related blocks
    "lg":  16,   # grid gutters, card padding
    "xl":  24,   # section separation, dialog padding
    "xxl": 32,   # air around an empty state / a top-anchored dialog
}

# Semantic radii — named by the surface they belong to, so a card and a
# dialog can never drift a pixel apart by accident.
#
# v13 COLLAPSES THE RAMP TO THREE TIERS, and that is the whole point of this
# revision rather than a tidy-up. Five steps (8/10/12/14/18) sound like a
# hierarchy and render as noise: a 10px button beside a 12px icon well
# beside a 14px card is three corners the eye reads as ONE family drawn
# slightly wrong, not as three levels of an intentional scale. Two pixels is
# under the threshold at which a corner difference reads as a decision, and
# above the threshold at which it reads as sloppiness — the worst possible
# place for it to sit. Every tier-1 desktop system this app is benchmarked
# against (Linear, Raycast, Fluent 2) ships a three-step ramp for exactly
# this reason.
#
# The three tiers, and the rule for picking one:
#
#   8  SMALL     — anything that is a LABEL rather than a surface: chips,
#                  badges, tags, count pills. At their ~17px height 8px is
#                  already a full pill, which is what a tag should be.
#   12 SURFACE   — anything you can point at and operate, plus the wells
#                  that hold a glyph: buttons, inputs, GlassCards, icon
#                  plaques, nav entries, list rows.
#   16 CONTAINER — anything that HOLDS surfaces: the sidebar, the content
#                  frame, dialog panels, the dashboard hero.
#
# The five semantic names survive because call sites should keep naming the
# surface, not the number — `RADIUS['card']` still says what it is, and
# three of them now deliberately resolve to the same step. That is the
# scale asserting that a card and a button ARE the same tier, which is a
# statement the old ramp could not make.
#
# The card step therefore rises 14 -> 12 (tightening toward the machined
# edge v11 was already reaching for) and the panel step falls 18 -> 16,
# closing the gap between a dialog and the card grid inside it.

    of v13's elevation pass.

    The cast shadow says "there is air under this". The sheen says "this
    has a top face". A surface with one and not the other reads as a
    sticker with a shadow printed behind it, which is exactly what the
    single hard-coded `150` left both themes with once shadow_alphas took
    its raise: a real shadow under a flat edge.

    Split per mode for the same reason bevel_alphas and glow_alphas are —
    the two canvases receive light in opposite directions — and the RESTING
    STRENGTH is part of the split rather than a shared 0.55, because the
    two modes are not spending the same budget on the same thing.

    DARK (200, 3.0, 0.55). On obsidian, white IS light: the top edge of a
    #22252E card lifting toward white is the literal thing a raised surface
    does under an overhead source, and it can be spent gradually. 150 was
    set when the sheen was a whisper on a card that separated by luminance
    anyway; the Apple/obsidian palette gave that separation up (the card
    measures 1.09:1 against its well) and the lit edge has to carry it.
    At rest this now lands the top row near 146/255 against a card body of
    34 — a rim you can see rather than one you can measure.

    LIGHT (255, 2.0, 0.95). The light card is already #FFFFFF, so a white
    sheen cannot brighten its FACE — but that was never the job. The job is
    the HAIRLINE: card_line is #B7BAC4 (183) against a #F2F2F7 (242) well,
    so an untreated top edge is DARKER than the page behind it. That is the
    optical signature of a groove, and no amount of shadow underneath fixes
    an edge that reads as cut into the paper.

    Light therefore spends nearly its whole budget at rest (0.95 of 255)
    to ERASE that top hairline — the row lands at ~251, indistinguishable
    from the card's own face — so the boundary stops being a drawn line and
    becomes a face-to-face luminance step from the card (255) to the well
    (242). The card's sides and bottom keep their #B7BAC4 outline, so the
    object reads: lit rim on top, defined flanks, shadow underneath. That
    is the macOS construction, and it is the one thing that makes a white
    card on a near-white page read as raised at all.

    A partial bleach was tried first and is worse than none: at the dark
    mode's 0.55 the light row lands at 219 — between the hairline and the
    well, so the edge is neither a line nor a lift, just a smudge.

    The fade is shorter on light (2.0 vs 3.0) because there is no dark body
    for the falloff to dissolve into; on paper a long fade only fogs the
    first three rows of the card.

    The resting value is the FLOOR, not the whole story: GlassCard adds
    HOVER_LIFT_SHEEN on top as the pointer arrives (clamped at 1.0), so a
    hovered card catches more light along its top edge in both modes.

    # is the LIGHTEST surface in the app and only has to clear the container

    # and a cast shadow (see shadow_alphas / sheen_alphas — that pairing is
    # what carries elevation here, not tone).
    #
    # DARKENING IS FREE FOR CONTRAST, which is why it can move this far in

    #  v12.1 — THE CALM RE-SOLVE (applies to every accent below, in
    #  BOTH themes). Read this once; the per-token notes assume it.
    #
    #  Through v12 the accents were solved for CONTRAST and for PEER
    #  PARITY, and both held. What nothing constrained was CHROMA, so
    #  each colour ended up as saturated as its hue happened to be at the
    #  lightness its ratio demanded. Measured, that was not a palette:
    #  accent/accent2/accent3, `software` and `automation` all sat at
    #  100% HSL saturation, `information` at 98.2%, `optimization` at
    #  96.6% — and OKLCh chroma across the set spanned 39.6% to 90.2%.
    #  A 2.3x spread means some modules shout and others whisper, which
    #  is precisely what stops a set reading as one system.
    #
    #  THE MOVE COSTS NO CONTRAST, and that is why it is safe to make
    #  across 26 tokens at once. WCAG's ratio is a function of RELATIVE
    #  LUMINANCE ONLY — saturation does not appear in it. So each colour
    #  is converted to OKLCh, its chroma scaled down, and its lightness
    #  then re-solved by bisection until it lands back on the luminance
    #  it started from. Measured across all 26: worst drift 0.02.
    #
    #  Scales are not uniform, because the tokens do not have the same
    #  job. Modules keep x0.65 — seven of them must stay tellable apart
    #  and CIE dE is what pays for that. Brand and semantic keep x0.62.
    #  `err` keeps x0.72: a failure tone is the one that must stay
    #  unmistakable, and it is also the only tone the eye needs to find
    #  without reading.
    #
    #  Mean module chroma: dark 14.2% -> 9.2%, light 14.8% -> 9.7%.
    #  The ceiling is pinned by test_contract's chroma-ceiling test —
    #  raising it walks the palette straight back toward neon.

    #
    # v12 RE-SOLVES THE WHOLE SET FOR PEER PARITY, which is a different
    # criterion from the one v10/v11 used. Those versions solved each colour
    # independently against a FLOOR (4.5:1 as text on the card, 3:1 as a
    # glyph in its own plaque well) and kept whatever it landed on. Every
    # value passed, and the set still did not read as a family: measured
    # in-plaque, the seven spanned 4.64:1 to 6.80:1 — a 1.46x spread — so
    # teal and amber carried visibly more weight than blue and pink, and the
    # "Spectrum" identity read as a few loud modules next to a few quiet
    # ones rather than as one system. (Light mode had already been solved
    # this way; see the peer-ratio note on _LIGHT's automation entry. Dark
    # never was.)
    #
    # Each colour is now solved along its OWN hue and saturation — nothing
    # here is re-hued for contrast — until it measures 5.50:1 against its
    # own plaque well.

    # v12.1 CARRIES THAT PARITY THROUGH THE CHROMA DRAIN. The re-solve
    # above is luminance-preserving, so the peer relationship the v12 work
    # bought is preserved by construction rather than re-derived: measured
    # after, the set sits in a 4.83-4.95 band in-plaque (1.025x, against a

    # ---- v11 "macOS SF" — system grey + pure white elevation ---------
    # v9.1/v10 fought the "harsh white void" by DARKENING THE PAGE: the
    # canvas floor fell to #b6c2da so a near-white card would have somewhere
    # to rise from. That solved the flatness and created a new problem — a
    # heavily tinted blue-slate page that no longer read as light mode, with
    # cards sitting in a cold gradient rather than on paper.

    # v11 takes the actual macOS construction instead: white is the figure,
    # grey is the ground, and cards are PURE WHITE throughout.

    # separation dropped the worst tone (warn) from 4.81:1 to 3.77:1 and

    # down (#EAEAF0) already fails at 4.48:1.

def icon_plaque_qss(t: dict, accent: str, featured: bool = False) -> str:
    """The v7 card icon container — a rounded, accent-tinted plaque holding
    one monochrome Fluent glyph (or its emoji fallback). This is the single
    biggest 'premium app' cue: instead of a bare emoji floating in the card,
    every icon sits in a consistent, color-coordinated well.

    v8.1 unification: EVERY card in EVERY section now shares the exact same
    plaque finish — identical tint, 1px accent line and monochrome glyph
    color — so the icon grid reads as one system page to page. The featured
    hero card earns its lift from its squircle body + Aurora lit edge, NOT a
    louder icon well, which previously made its glyph look bigger/brighter
    than its siblings and broke cross-category consistency. `featured` is
    still accepted for call-site compatibility but no longer alters the
    plaque.

    v9 "Spectrum": the plaque now carries REAL color at rest. Where v8.1
    deliberately went fully monochrome (a soft text_soft glyph in a whisper
    tint), v9 fills the well with a soft vertical accent gradient, firms its
    hairline, and — the key move — paints the glyph in the module's own
    accent. Every card and every sidebar entry therefore reads in its
    module's color the instant the page loads, not only on hover, which is
    what turns the old flat-gray grid into a vibrant, legible spectrum. The
    tint stays low enough (≤0.24α) that the glyph, not the well, is the
    focus, so the effect is jewel-like, never neon.

    v12 SPLITS THE TINT PER MODE, because the two canvases work in opposite
    directions and one pair of alphas cannot serve both. On obsidian the
    tint DARKENS the well, pushing it away from the glyph and adding
    contrast; on paper the very same tint LIGHTENS nothing — it drops a
    colour wash between a white card and a dark ink glyph, and every point
    of alpha subtracts from the thing the plaque exists to make legible.
    Measured, light mode ran 3.46-3.70:1 in-plaque against dark's
    4.64-6.80:1 — the whole mode about a third weaker, which is exactly the
    washed-out quality the light renders showed.

    Dark keeps 0.24/0.13, the alphas its accents were solved against.
    Light drops to 0.15/0.08, which lifts it to 3.89-4.05:1 while keeping
    the well plainly tinted; below about 0.11 the gain flattens out and the
    plaque stops reading as coloured at all, which would trade one mode's
    weakness for another's.

    v13 HANDS THE WELL TO THE PAINTER and keeps only the glyph here. The
    plaque was a QSS rectangle: one flat gradient inside one flat 1px
    border, sitting directly on the card with nothing between them. That is
    a coloured box behind a glyph, and next to a Linear or Raycast icon
    chip it reads exactly like one.

    Three things a premium plaque has that QSS cannot express on a QLabel —
    an ambient halo bleeding OUTSIDE the well, a second hairline INSIDE the
    first, and a lit top rim on the well itself — are now painted by
    widgets.IconPlaque, which composites the identical gradient underneath
    them. The tint alphas therefore did not move (see plaque_tints): the
    contrast solve above is still exactly what ships, and everything v13
    adds lives at the plaque's EDGE, where it cannot subtract from the
    glyph's legibility.

    What stays in QSS is the glyph's own colour, plus an explicitly
    transparent background and no border — without those two a QLabel
    inherits the card's sheet and would paint a second, unstyled box on
    top of everything the painter just did.

                                  two toned verdicts beside it.

    THE FILL IS AN OPAQUE PLATE AT THE CARD TIER, not a translucent wash of
    the chip's own hue, and that is a contrast fix as much as a finish one.

    A pill tinted in its own tone subtracts contrast from the text it
    carries — the "badge-tint trap" strip_status_qss documents and avoids.
    These chips were doing it anyway, at 9px, the smallest type in the app.
    Measured against the worst surface a chip can land on (a card wearing a
    STATE_TINT wash while running or flashing):

        light mode, own-hue fill at 0.12 ... 4.02:1   <- under AA
        light mode, opaque card plate ...... 4.81:1
        dark mode,  own-hue fill at 0.12 ... 4.93:1
        dark mode,  opaque card plate ...... 6.23:1

    Blending the whisper of tone into an OPAQUE colour (rather than laying
    a translucent one over whatever is beneath) buys a second property that
    matters more than the ratio: the chip now reads identically on a
    resting card, a running card and a flashing one. Its own state is the
    only thing it reports, which is the entire job of a status badge.

    All three verdicts share one geometry and one material so they read as
    one control at three settings — the neutral DEFAULT used to be the odd
    one out, transparent where the toned pair were filled, which made "at
    Windows defaults" look like a different kind of object.

      * hover  — the tone's border firms up, the standard "this is clickable"
      * ACTIVE — filled with the tone at full strength, because the one thing
        a filter must never do is leave the user unable to tell that the list
        in front of them is filtered.

    THE ACTIVE STATE IS A SOLID FILL, not a heavier tint, and that is a
    contrast decision rather than a taste one. The obvious alternative —
    keeping the tone as the TEXT colour over a stronger tone-tinted fill —
    measures 3.94:1 for accent and 3.95:1 for warn against the light theme's
    white card, i.e. it fails AA on exactly the state that most needs to be
    readable. Flipping to the canvas colour on a solid tone fill measures
    4.81:1 at its worst (light/warn) and 13.26:1 at its best, so every tone
    clears AA in both themes.

    Hover on an ACTIVE chip therefore moves only the border. Touching the
    fill or the text would put that hard-won 4.81:1 back in play for the sake
    of a hover cue, and the border ring reads just as clearly.

# -- label roles ---------------------------------------------
# v7 typographic scale: the v6.2 ramp was flat in the middle — card(14) /
# body(13) / desc(12) sat nearly indistinguishable, so cards had no clear
# focal point. v7 WIDENS that middle: the card TITLE jumps to 16/650 to
# lead unmistakably, while `desc` lifts to 13px on the brighter `text_soft`
# so the title-vs-description gap now reads in BOTH size and tone (hierarchy
# from contrast, per the app's standing philosophy — just tuned harder).
# A new `meta` role carries the card footer's count pills / hints.
#
# v13 SHARPENS THE TOP OF THE RAMP, because the middle was widened in v7
# and then nothing was ever done about the WEIGHT. Titles shipped at 650
# and 680 — values that exist in no type system, land on whatever Qt
# rounds them to, and read as "a bit bolder than the body" rather than as
# a different kind of text. A card title is the first thing read on a
# card and the only thing read when scanning a grid of nine; it has to
# separate from the description underneath it instantly, and 650 against
# the description's 400 was doing that on size alone.
#
# Titles now sit on the WEIGHT scale proper (semi/bold — the two steps
# that carry meaning) and carry NEGATIVE TRACKING, which is the half
# nobody thinks to add. At display sizes the default spacing that suits
# 12px body copy leaves large text looking loose and slightly unresolved;
# pulling it in is what makes a heading read as machined. The pull scales
# with the size (-0.5px at 22, -0.3px at 18, -0.2px at 16) because
# tracking is an optical correction, not a constant — applying the
# hero's -0.5 to a 16px card title would visibly jam the letters.

# GAP between the two, and every point of weight added to the muted half

    Pairs with elevate_button_qss as the rail's two footer controls.

    Its size, weight and tracking are DERIVED from the `caption` label role
    it replaced, not retyped, so the line that closes the rail looks
    exactly as quiet as it always did — a control announcing itself here
    would re-weight a zone deliberately kept calm. (The COLOUR is no longer
    taken from that role; see the v12.1 note below.)

    But it is clickable, and it shipped with no hover or press state at
    all: the affordance was invisible, discoverable only by clicking the
    version number on a hunch. Hover therefore lifts the text the FULL way
    (to `text`) over an accent wash and hairline, and press pushes both
    further while dimming the text, so the click is acknowledged on the
    way down.

    The first attempt lifted the WASH only one step, to `card_hover`, whose
    7.5% alpha is all but invisible against the rail — it technically had a
    hover state and still failed the thing a hover state is for.
    Discoverability is the requirement, so the contrast has to be legible,
    not merely present.

    The rest state paints NOTHING — but it reserves the border as
    `1px solid transparent`, so the hairline appearing on hover cannot
    reflow the footer by two pixels the moment the pointer arrives.

    v12.1 LIFTS THE REST COLOUR OFF THE FLOOR, and hands its status job
    away. This line used to carry the updater's answer too ("… · Update
    available"), appended to its own text — the app's most actionable
    notification, rendered at the `caption` role: 10px, weight 500, on
    text_faint, the quietest step in the ramp. Measured on the sidebar
    panel that is 5.37:1 dark / 5.13:1 light — legible on paper and
    invisible in practice, and it only became emphatic once the pointer
    arrived. Update status now lives in the Activity rail's UpdatePill
    (update_pill_qss), which is toned, plated and AA at rest.

    What stays here is identity — and a control, still: clicking it is
    the rail's manual "check for updates". A CONTROL MUST NOT SIT ON THE
    TEXT FLOOR, so the resting colour is derived from the `status` role
    (text_muted, 7.94:1 light / 9.11:1 dark) while keeping the caption
    role's size, weight and tracking: the line reads exactly as quiet as
    it always did, at a weight you can actually resolve.
