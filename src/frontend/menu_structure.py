src/frontend/menu_structure.py

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the entire GUI menu hierarchy.

Adding a new button to the app = adding ONE dict to an `items` list below.
main.py renders whatever is defined here — no UI code changes needed.

Contract with the backend (src/backend/core.ps1 + src/backend/modules/):
    Every `task` value maps 1:1 to a `switch ($TaskName)` case inside the
    Invoke-GuiTask dispatcher (src/backend/modules/30-GuiDispatcher.ps1,
    loaded by core.ps1), which must emit exactly one final
    `##PULSE##SUCCESS|message` or `##PULSE##ERROR|message` verdict line on
    stdout. The GUI always invokes core.ps1 itself - never a module file
    directly.

    Tasks starting with "@" are LOCAL actions handled by the GUI itself
    (no PowerShell process is spawned by main.py's task pipeline):
        @open_log              -> opens %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Pulse\\logs\\Pulse_Log.txt
        @open_onedrive_backup  -> opens ...\\PULSE\\Backups\\OneDrive
        @open_edge_backup      -> opens ...\\PULSE\\Backups\\Edge
        @playbooks             -> widgets.PlaybookDialog
        @health_report         -> widgets.HealthReportDialog
        @activation            -> widgets.ActivationStatusDialog
    The last three open a Pulse surface rather than a file. Each dialog
    runs its OWN PowerShellTask (HealthReport / ActivationStatus) rather
    than going through request_task, which is why those backend cases are
    allow-listed in tests/test_contract.py::_PROGRAMMATIC instead of being
    reachable from a card's `task`.

Item schema:
    NOTE ON `accent` (v10): a category's "accent" is a SEMANTIC MODULE KEY
    ("software", "optimization", ...), not a colour. The literal hex for
    each key lives in theme.py's per-mode token sets and is resolved at
    paint time via theme.resolve_accent(t, key), so the palette can differ
    between dark and light. It has to: the old shared hex values measured
    1.86-2.64:1 against the light-mode card, well under the 3:1 floor for
    an icon, which washed the whole colour system out in light mode.
    Widgets store the KEY and re-resolve inside apply_theme().

    icon     str   emoji shown on the card
    title    str   card headline
    desc     str   one-line explanation shown under the title
    task     str   core.ps1 -Task name, or "@local_action"
    timeout  int   seconds before the GUI declares a timeout   (default 300)
    confirm  bool  show a confirmation dialog before running   (default False)
    danger   bool  style the card/confirm dialog as destructive (default False)
    note     str   small badge, e.g. "Windows 11 only"          (default "")
    recurring int  ROUTINE task: the re-run interval in days (default absent
             = one-shot). A one-shot tweak has durable readable state and
             badges APPLIED / MODIFIED / DEFAULT from 11-StateProbe.ps1; a
             routine has none — it was run, and then time passed — so it
             badges ACTION DUE once `recurring` days have elapsed since its
             last run, and otherwise shows only its "Ran 3d ago" caption.
             See recurring_days() below and main.PulseApp._card_badge.
    wizard   str   when present, the GUI opens a dedicated multi-step wizard
             dialog instead of the catalog / confirm dialog (checked before
             both). Currently only "office" -> widgets.OfficeWizardDialog,
             which resolves a setup.exe/configuration.xml pair and passes
             them to core.ps1 as -OfficeSetupPath/-OfficeConfigPath. A task
             using "wizard" should not also set "catalog" or "confirm".
    catalog  bool   when True, the GUI opens widgets.SoftwareCatalogDialog —
             the UNIFIED software hub: one scrollable list of every
             installable app, with a sub-category tab bar (All / Browsers &
             Media / Development & Tools / Gaming Launchers / System
             Runtimes & Utilities) filtering it in place, dependency hints
             and the same per-row "..." install-options wizard every other
             selector uses. Checked before "wizard"/"confirm". Sourced from
             SOFTWARE_CATALOG below, which mirrors $Apps_CatalogAll in
             01-Catalogs.ps1 (same IDs, same
             order) - the backend is the source of truth for what winget ID
             each entry installs; the GUI list is only its mirror. The
             ticked AppIds go to core.ps1 via -AppIds, and because the tabs
             filter one list rather than paging between several, a single
             deploy can span sub-categories.

             This REPLACED a per-card `apps` list (4-tuples of AppId /
             DisplayName / Description / Url), which existed once per app
             pack and gave the app four different front doors.
    update_center  bool  when True, the GUI opens widgets.UpdateCenterDialog
             instead of every other selector — it runs its own live winget
             scan (task ScanForUpdates), shows a current-vs-available
             version audit, and hands back the ticked AppIds. main.py then
             runs "task" (UpdateSelectedApps) with those AppIds through the
             normal pipeline, exactly like a catalog selection would.
    startup_manager  bool  when True, the GUI opens
             widgets.StartupManagerDialog instead of running "task"
             directly — a self-contained optimization hub (scan, group by
             recommendation, live per-item ToggleSwitch) that never hands
             anything back; main.py just opens it and moves on.
    hub      bool + items list[dict]  when True, this entry is a container,
             not a runnable action — it has no "task" and is never passed
             to core.ps1. Clicking it opens widgets.HubDialog (a single
             sub-item skips straight to that sub-item instead) rendering
             `items` as the same GlassCards a category page uses; picking
             one runs it through request_task() exactly as if it had lived
             on the page directly.

             A hub is for a set of actions that are only safe or sensible
             to offer TOGETHER — see Microsoft Edge / Microsoft OneDrive in
             CATEGORIES["software"], where a teardown is kept beside its
             counterpart restore. It is NOT a device for thinning a busy
             page: SECTION BANDS do that (see category_bands) without
             costing a click. The v1.1 reorganization deleted the one hub
             that was doing the latter job — "System Tools & Utilities",
             which had collected PATH Doctor, the Startup Manager and
             Check for Updates behind a name that collided with the
             Utilities & Tools MODULE, and had buried the app's single
             highest-frequency software action two clicks deep. All three
             are top-level cards now.

             iter_leaf_items() below expands every hub so leaf
             actions stay reachable from the Ctrl+K command palette.
             A hub's sub-action may carry `action`: the VERB its
             button says (widgets.ActionRow). Optional, and derived
             when absent — but a derived verb is a guess about the
             title's wording, and these five are the rows a user
             reads before doing something irreversible, so they say
             it themselves.

             A hub may instead supply `groups` (list of
             {"title": str, "items": list[dict]}) in place of a flat
             `items` list: the HubDialog then renders each group's title as
             a small "section" header above its cards, so a hub with many
             sub-actions stays tidy and scannable. NO hub uses `groups`
             today — the System Tools hub did until the v1.0 RC lifted Edge
             and OneDrive out of it onto the page, and the hub itself is
             gone as of v1.1 — but both shapes stay supported, and
             hub_items() flattens either, so counters, the command palette
             and hub navigation treat grouped and flat hubs identically.

# ============================================================
#  THE UNIFIED SOFTWARE CATALOG  (v1.0 RC)
#
#  ONE list of every installable app the GUI offers, split into the four
#  sub-categories the catalog's tab bar filters by. This replaced FOUR
#  separate cards — Essential Apps, Developer & University Hub, Gaming
#  Launchers, Hardware Diagnostics — each with its own dispatcher case and
#  its own selector dialog. That split made "where do I get Docker?" and
#  "where do I get VLC?" different questions with different answers, and
#  made a mixed selection (one browser, one IDE, one launcher) impossible
#  without three separate deploys. The tabs are a VIEW over this single
#  list, not four lists behind a shared frame.
#
#  Mirrors 01-Catalogs.ps1's $Apps_CatalogAll — same IDs, SAME ORDER,
#  section for section. The backend stays the source of truth for what
#  winget ID each entry installs; this is the GUI's mirror, extended with
#  the description / URL / dependency-hint metadata a bare (AppId,
#  DisplayName) pair cannot carry.
#
#  Section schema:
#     key    str   stable id used by the tab bar and by tests
#     icon   str   emoji shown on the tab
#     title  str   the tab's label
#     blurb  str   one line under the catalog header when the tab is active
#     groups list[(group_title, tools)]  — a group_title of "" renders the
#            tools with no sub-header (a section that needs no internal
#            division); anything else renders as a small section header
#            inside the tab, so a 16-entry tab stays scannable.
#
#  Each tool entry: (AppId, DisplayName, WhyYouNeedIt, OfficialUrl,
#                     RequiresAppId | None, RequiresDisplayName | None)

# a non-elevated admin action shows an inline "relaunch elevated" prompt
# instead of a spawn-then-fail round trip, and admin-gated Quick Action cards
# can show a lock affordance up front.
#
# tests/test_contract.py::test_admin_gate_mirrors_are_identical asserts the
# two lists are EQUAL. That check is new in v1.1, and it found the drift it
# was written for: the two HKLM-policy reverts below were gated in the
# backend and missing here, so reverting telemetry or activity history on an
# unelevated Pulse spawned PowerShell and came back with a failure instead of
# offering the one-click elevate. The comment that used to sit here claimed
# an equality check already existed. It did not — which is exactly how the
# lists drifted while both files said they could not.
#
# Software install/update tasks are deliberately absent for the same reason
# the backend omits them: winget + each installer handle their own elevation,
# and blanket-requiring admin breaks user-scope / elevation-prohibited
