DECLARATIVE AUTOMATION PROFILES (v10.3).

A playbook is an ordered list of tasks the engine already knows how to run
— "new machine -> apply Post-Install Clean -> walk away". It adds no new
capability to the backend and deliberately cannot: a step is just a `task`
name, dispatched through exactly the same contract a card click uses, so a
playbook can never reach anything the GUI could not already reach, and
nothing here needs a matching dispatcher case of its own.

WHY JSON ON DISK RATHER THAN A PYTHON LIST
    menu_structure.py is the catalog of what the app CAN do; that belongs
    in code because each entry carries behaviour flags the GUI branches on.
    A playbook is a user-editable recipe over that catalog — a technician
    should be able to drop `workstation-standard.json` next to the shipped
    three without touching Python or rebuilding the exe.

VALIDATION IS A FEATURE, NOT A FORMALITY
    A playbook naming a task that does not exist would fail at step N,
    halfway through mutating a machine. Every playbook is therefore
    validated against the live catalog at LOAD time, and an invalid one is
    reported rather than silently skipped: a technician who mistyped a task
    name needs to know before they walk away, not after.
