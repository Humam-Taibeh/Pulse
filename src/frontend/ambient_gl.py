THE AMBIENT FIELD, RENDERED ON THE GPU (v10.3).

WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED
    The raster field (widgets.AmbientGlow) is the bottom widget in the
    shell, and every surface above it is translucent by design. So a
    repaint there is never "repaint the wash": Qt must re-rasterise the
    whole translucent stack on the GUI thread. Measured on the reference
    machine at 1300x860, in a REAL event loop with real idle between
    frames (a tight update/processEvents loop measures vsync busy-wait,
    not work — every arm of the first four probes came back at wall
    5.556ms, i.e. exactly 180.0fps, which is the swap interval and not a
    cost):

        raster @ 10Hz (what shipped) ...  4.3% of one core
        raster @ 60Hz ................. 40.2% of one core
        GPU    @ 60Hz ................. 10.9% of one core

    60fps on the raster path costs 40% of a core for a background
    decoration. On the GPU it costs a quarter of that, for six times the
    frame rate of the shipped field.

THE STRUCTURAL REASON IT WORKS
    A QOpenGLWidget renders into its own texture, which the compositor
    blends with the backing store holding the widgets above it. Animating
    it therefore does NOT re-rasterise them. Verified rather than assumed,
    because Qt's own docs warn about widgets overlapping a QOpenGLWidget:
    with the sidebar, content well and fourteen cards stacked on top,
    driving this widget at 60fps produced **0.000 card repaints per
    frame**. That single number is what the whole approach rests on.

WHAT IS SHARED WITH THE RASTER PATH, AND WHY
    Only the DRAWING moves to the GPU. The simulation — the seeded
    scatter, the per-tier drift, the wrap, the sway, the twinkle phase,
    the pointer bias — stays exactly where it was, in the code the raster
    field already uses (widgets._AmbientSimulation). Two reasons, both
    practical:

      1. Visual parity is by construction rather than by careful
         re-derivation. A star is in the same place in both renderers
         because the same arithmetic put it there.
      2. It is free. Integrating 126 particles is microseconds; the cost
         was never the maths, it was the full-window repaint the maths
         triggered.

    Per frame this uploads 126 x vec4 (~2KB) and issues three draws. The
    per-star parameters ride in a vertex buffer rather than a uniform
    array precisely so the count can grow without hitting a uniform limit.

FALLBACK IS AUTOMATIC AND SILENT
    See capability(). A machine without GL, or with SOFTWARE-EMULATED GL
    (llvmpipe / WARP / GDI generic — common under RDP and in VMs), gets
    the raster field with no setting to find and no message to dismiss.
    Software GL is explicitly treated as "no GL": it is slower than the
    raster path, so taking it would make the field worse on exactly the
    machines least able to afford it.

        The SIMULATION is logical: star positions, orb geometry and the

        (glViewport, gl_PointSize) therefore needs the device numbers,
        and everything normalised against `res` needs the logical ones.

        the viewport with glViewport(0, 0, w, h) in LOGICAL pixels after
        rendering the orb buffer, so on a 1.25x display the blit and the

        1504x954 framebuffer — leaving an unpainted band across the top
        and down the right edge, which composited as a displaced grey
        rectangle hanging outside the shell. It struck about one frame in
        six because the orb buffer only rebuilds on its 100 ms cadence,

        constant offset, and it disappeared at integer scaling (where
