COMPONENT LIBRARY — isolated, theme-aware, effect-free custom widgets.

Every widget here:
    - takes its QSS from theme.py factories (never inline color literals),
    - exposes apply_theme(t) for live re-skinning (ThemeManager.changed),
    - paints its hover glow itself via animations.GlowController +
      paint_glow_frame — zero QGraphicsEffect in steady state.

    #:

        The old code kept the capture small and let paintEvent magnify it
        on every repaint, on the reasoning that the upscale carries no
        extra information. It carries no extra INFORMATION and it carries a
        very visible ARTIFACT: one bilinear pass over a 10x magnification
        leaves each source texel as a flat square with a one-pixel ramp
        around it, which is a grid of chunky blocks rather than a blur.

        Two things fix it, and both belong here rather than in paintEvent:

          * a box blur on the SMALL image, where it costs microseconds and
            removes the sharp texel-to-texel steps that magnification would
            otherwise turn into visible tile edges;
          * a two-STAGE smooth upscale. Bilinear only interpolates between
            adjacent source texels, so one 6x jump still reproduces the
            grid; going through an intermediate doubles the interpolation
            and dissolves it.

        Resolving once here COSTS a little at steady state rather than
        saving it, which is worth stating because the opposite is the
        intuitive guess. Measured on a 1400x850 sheet at 1.25x: a repaint
        blitting the resolved 1750x1062 pixmap 1:1 runs 3.83 ms against
        3.53 ms for magnifying the tiny one. Drawing 1.9M pixels is simply
        more memory traffic than smoothing 12K up, however many times the
        scaler runs. The pixmap also costs ~1.9 MB for as long as the sheet
        is open.

        Both are paid deliberately: 0.3 ms on a surface that repaints on
        hover, for a backdrop with no visible tiling in it. The capture
        itself went 6.6 -> 12.7 ms for the same reason (a 1/6 render at
        device resolution rasterises more than a 1/10 render at logical
        resolution), and lands on the one frame already hidden behind the

    ClampedLabel solves the vertical version of this problem; this is the
    horizontal one, and it exists because of a regression measured while
    adding the v10.1 run-history pill: dropping a plain QLabel into the
    card footer took GlassCard.minimumSizeHint() from 184px to 337px once
    both it and the APPLIED chip were visible.

    That is the v9.1 density bug returning by another door. The footer was
    deliberately built so a card's minimum is the MAX of its rows and not
    their SUM — a plain QLabel breaks that, because QHBoxLayout adds every
    child's minimum width together, and the widest caption ("1y ago ·
    ~1.5h") therefore becomes a floor the responsive grid must honour on
    every card forever.

    Two mechanisms keep it honest:
      * a MINIMUM width of zero, so the layout is never obliged to find
        room for the text and the card's floor is unaffected, while the
        size policy stays Preferred so the caption is still granted its
        natural width whenever the row has room, and
      * elision to whatever width it actually receives, so a squeezed
        caption degrades to "1y ago…" rather than being clipped mid-glyph.

    The size policy is deliberately NOT Ignored. Ignored discards the
    sizeHint outright, which — next to the footer's trailing stretch —
    collapsed the caption to zero width and painted nothing at all, while
    still reporting isVisible() as True. That shipped past unit tests
    asserting on visibility and text; only a screenshot showed the cards
    were blank. test_history_pill_is_actually_painted now pins the width.

    The untruncated text always remains in the tooltip.

    outermost pixel — so nothing new lands between the glyph and its
    background. The in-plaque contrast solve icon_plaque_qss documents
    measures the same before and after, which is why it did not have to be
    re-run.

    STATIC. No timer, no animation, no QGraphicsEffect: the whole thing is
    four cached-cheap strokes and a fill, repainted only when the card

    #   ... plus the optional meta footer (gap 8 + pill 20)       = 155
    # Because ClampedLabel caps each block at an exact line count, 156 is a
    # ceiling the content genuinely cannot exceed — which is what makes a
    # maximum safe at all. (Pre-v10 the cap was 146 and content simply
    # overflowed it invisibly; the minimum was 112, itself below the 119 a
    # three-line description needed, so the minimum could clip too.)

    # Both numbers move with the padding: the whole point of deriving them

    # measuring the running app rather than by reading this comment.

    # First, the floor was not being applied at all. minimumSizeHint()
    # below has clamped to CARD_MIN_H since v10, but a card's rendered
    # height does not come from its minimum: CategoryPage._relayout gives
    # content rows ZERO stretch (so a short page anchors to the top instead
    # of floating in the middle), and an unstretched QGridLayout row takes
    # its height from sizeHint(), which GlassCard did not override. Measured
    # across all 41 cards, 26 rendered BELOW the documented 128px floor and
    # three at 101px. The floor was real in the source and fictional on
    # screen.
    #
    # Second, even honoured, a free-floating height produced seven distinct
    # card heights across four modules — cards that match inside a band and
    # visibly disagree across bands, which is precisely the "almost
    # aligned" quality the SPACE scale was introduced to remove. Heights
    # now snap UP to one of three steps, so a page reads as two or three
    # deliberate sizes instead of a continuum of near-misses.
    #
    # The steps are the anatomy's own breakpoints, not arbitrary thirds:

        QGridLayout takes the row height from QWidgetItem::heightForWidth
        rather than from sizeHint() or minimumSizeHint() — which is why

    #  STAR WEIGHT — solved against the WORST SURFACE COVERING IT
    # ================================================================
    # The field used to carry one peak alpha for both themes (0.34), tuned
    # against the bare canvas. But nobody sees a star against the bare
    # canvas: the wash sits at the BOTTOM of the shell, so every star is
    # viewed through whatever translucent surface is over it — the content
    # well and the sidebar, which are `rgba(242,242,247,0.55)` and
    # `rgba(255,255,255,0.60)` in light. Those cut a star's delta by 45%
    # and 60% before it ever reaches the eye.
    #
    # That is the same mistake the palette's AA floor made and fixed (see
    # the text_faint note in theme.py): a value solved against the surface
    # you WISH it sat on, when the surface it actually lands on is darker,
    # paler or busier. The fix is the same too — solve against the worst
    # case, so it clears everywhere rather than only where it was measured.
    #
    # MEASURED, in CIE76 dE through the worst covering surface in each
    # theme, at full twinkle (mean over the whole sprite, which is what the
    # eye integrates for a 4-16px dot):
    #
    #                  dark (shipped)      light BEFORE      light NOW

    #
    # Light was running at 60-65% of dark's weight — the far tier, 46% of
    # the whole field, sat UNDER the ~1.0 dE just-noticeable threshold.
    # That is not "subtle", it is absent, and it is why the mode read as
    # having no particles rather than as having quiet ones.
    #
    # DARK IS UNTOUCHED. Light is solved TO dark's proven weight rather
    # than to a number of its own: the two modes must read as the same
    # field seen in different light, and dark is the one that was already
    # right.

    # the same peak, and the asymmetry is real rather than a fudge: light
    # ink on a dark canvas ADDS luminance, which the eye detects at far
    # smaller areas than the equivalent subtraction of a dark mote on
    # paper. Raising alpha alone would have produced hard little dots
    # instead of light; the extra tail is what keeps them reading as
    # atmosphere at the higher weight.

    #:
    #: DARK COMES DOWN 40% IN v14, and the reason is that the surfaces
    #: underneath it moved. The old peaks were solved against a content
    #: well that was 45% NEAR-BLACK, so the frame the wash showed through
    #: subtracted from it; the obsidian palette raises that well to a
    #: #121417 container and the same wash now lands on a base ~11 levels
    #: lighter, over the whole content area. Measured on a real render, the
    #: v13 peaks took the jet #090A0B canvas to #1A1D25 in the orb cores —
    #: which is precisely the "muddy navy-tinted grey" the obsidian pass
    #: exists to remove, arrived at from the ambient layer rather than from

    #: channel 32 against the canvas's 11) and the base reads as jet.

#  AMBIENT GLOW — static brand-pair light wash behind the shell
# ============================================================
class AmbientGlow(_AmbientSimulation, QWidget):
    """A LIVING canvas behind the sidebar/content frames (lowest widget in
    the shell's z-order, transparent to mouse events).

    Two motion layers, both engineered to stay cheap:

    1. Aurora orbs — FIVE soft brand-tinted radial blobs (indigo / violet /
       magenta) that slowly DRIFT on independent sine paths and BREATHE (a
       gentle opacity pulse). Three are the large foreground wash; two are
       smaller, dimmer and lean harder on the pointer parallax, which is
       what gives the field a front and a back instead of one flat sheet.
       Each orb is a radial-gradient PIXMAP rendered once and cached, then
       blitted at its drifting position — a GPU-friendly blit, not a
       per-frame gradient rasterization, so the animation costs
       microseconds even full-screen.
    2. Particle field — a scatter of soft 'stars' drifting upward and
       twinkling, wrapping around the top. Three DEPTH TIERS (see
       _PARTICLE_TIERS): far stars are small, dim and slow, near ones
       larger, brighter and quicker, so the field has parallax rather than
       uniform noise. Each star is a cached soft-glow texture blitted at
       its own scale, not a hard-edged ellipse.

    Driven by ONE self-rescheduling timer (see _INTERVAL_MS and _arm) that
    suspends whenever the widget is hidden, so a minimized or backgrounded
    window pays nothing. DENSITY IS NOT INTENSITY: the count went up 3x,
    the per-star peak alpha did not (theme.py documents why the brand pair
    reads neon past ~0.16) — this is ambient luminescence, never a light
    show."""

    # ================================================================
    #  FRAME RATE — matched to the signal, and governed under load
    # ================================================================
    # This widget is the BOTTOM of the shell's z-order and every surface
    # above it is translucent by design (the content frame is
    # rgba(5, 6, 10, 0.45); the cards are glass). So a Qt update() here is
    # never "repaint the wash": it dirties the full window, and Qt must
    # then repaint every non-opaque widget intersecting it, bottom-up.
    #
    # Measured on the reference machine at 1300x860, one ambient frame:
    #
    #     the glow's own paint ..............  2.7 ms
    #     every widget above it ............. 15.7 ms   <- 85% of the frame
    #     ---------------------------------------------
    #     tick -> window settled ............ 18.5 ms
    #
    # of which the 14-card grid alone is 10.9 ms. At the old 36 ms interval
    # that saturated the GUI thread: sampled over 3.0 s of idle, the app
    # blocked itself for 1385 ms — 46.2% of wall time — in blocks of up to
    # 31 ms, and the timer could only actually deliver 21 of the 28 frames
    # it asked for. Every click, hover and page switch queued behind that,
    # which is what "the app feels like it's freezing" was.
    #
    # The rate is now derived instead of chosen, and the derivation is the
    # whole argument for it being free: _LAYER_MS already rebuilds the orb
    # composite only 10x a second, so at 36 ms THE ORBS WERE IDENTICAL ON
    # THREE CONSECUTIVE FRAMES — two of every three full-window repaints
    # painted the same aurora. Sampling the wash at the cadence it actually
    # changes at is not a quality cut; it is deleting duplicate frames.
    #
    # The only thing that moved faster was the star field, and barely: the
    # quickest tier drifts 0.044 of the widget height per second, so 38 px/s
    # — 3.8 px per frame at this interval, on a sprite whose soft glow tail
    # is ~16 px wide. Twinkle tops out at 1.4 Hz and is still sampled seven

    nothing back, so entangling it with the shell's single-task pipeline
    would let opening a read-only report block a real operation.

    SCOPE, deliberately: this dialog REPORTS. Neither it nor
    13-Activation.ps1 behind it installs a product key, contacts a
    licensing server, or alters licence state in any way — which is also
    why it needs no elevation and no confirm step. When something does
    need changing it hands off to Windows' own Activation page, where the
    user sees and controls exactly what happens.

    #: the Settings app opens visibly, in front of the user, and Pulse has
    #: no further part in whatever they do there.

    #: Microsoft's own activation documentation — the single external
    #: reference this dialog offers (v11).
    #:
    #: It replaces two blocks that used to close the report: a set of
    #: copyable `slmgr` commands and three paragraphs of hand-written
    #: activation advice. Both were well-intentioned and both were the wrong
    #: shape for this dialog. The commands invited a reader to open a
    #: terminal to re-read facts the dialog had just shown them, and the
    #: advice was a snapshot of Microsoft's licensing rules maintained here,
    #: in a Windows utility, where it can only drift out of date. One
    #: authoritative link is smaller, always current, and honest about whose
    #: answer it is.
    #:
    #: It points at Microsoft. A licence is bought or already owned and then
    #: applied through Microsoft's surfaces; Pulse reports state and hands
    #: off, and that contract does not survive linking anywhere else.

    Each runs its OWN PowerShellTask rather than going through main.py's
    single-task pipeline, for the reason ActivationStatusDialog documents:
    a self-contained panel that hands nothing back must not be able to
    block a real operation just by being open.

    WHAT THE BASE PROVIDES is the READ half: run one backend task, take
    its DATA document, render it, and offer a re-check. Subclasses supply
    a task name, a title and a `_render`.

    THE THREE INSPECTORS THEMSELVES ARE READ-ONLY — that is a property of
    Power Health, Restore Points and Storage Analyzer, not of this class.
    Each reads, renders and stops; where an action genuinely belongs
    (open Explorer, run System Restore) they hand off to the Windows
    surface that owns it, visibly, and take no further part.
    tests/test_contract.py asserts that of the modules behind them.

    DnsSwitcherDialog also builds on this, and it DOES mutate. It is not
    a violation of the above: what it inherits is the scan-and-render
    plumbing, and its own changes are elevated, per-adapter and paired
    with a restore. A subclass that mutates owes the user an undo.

    subtly. Seeing the entry is useful; being offered a switch for it is
    not.

    NOTHING IS DELETED. Hiding an entry adds its CLSID to Windows' own

    'available' opens the update dialog, anything else re-checks. Styled
    entirely by theme.update_badge_qss through the dynamic `state`
    property — the same repolish mechanic StatePill uses, so a transition
    never rebuilds QSS and nothing here runs off a timer.

    IT SHOWS ONLY WHEN IT HAS SOMETHING ACTIONABLE TO SAY. v14 moved this
    off the Activity rail (where it was one of seven controls competing
    with the running task the rail exists to report) and into the sidebar
    footer, directly above the identity line that was already the manual
    "check for updates" trigger — so the answer and the control are one
    place instead of two that have to agree.

    The visibility rule is the whole point of the move, and it is a rule
    about WHAT IS WORTH A PERMANENT SURFACE:

      * `available` — shown. This is the app's most actionable
        notification and it must stay findable after its toast has gone.
      * `checking`  — shown only for a check the USER asked for. A silent
        launch check that pops a chip into the rail is the app talking
        about itself for no reason.
      * `current`   — hidden. "Nothing is wrong" is reported by a toast on
        the manual path and by silence otherwise; a chip that permanently
        says nothing is happening is chrome, which is exactly what this
        pass is removing.

    AND IT STANDS DOWN WHILE A TASK RUNS (set_busy, driven by
    main.PulseApp._set_busy_ui). Not for width now that it has left the
    rail, but because it is not actionable mid-run:
    main._open_update_dialog already refuses to start an install while the
    engine is mutating the machine (the _busy() guard) and tells the user
    to wait. Suppressing it removes a control that could not have been
    used anyway.

           0.075)' — QSS notation, which QColor rejects, yielding an INVALID
           QColor that Qt paints as opaque BLACK. Every switch in the Startup

           on the light card (#ffffff) that was the most conspicuous surface

        2. Alpha would have been dropped anyway. paintEvent rebuilds the
           track from .red()/.green()/.blue() to cross-fade toward `ok`, so a
           translucent QColor loses its alpha there and paints at full
           strength — pure white in dark mode.

        So the tint is flattened HERE, against the opaque row surface
        (bg_solid + card), exactly the way TH.blend() and the contrast tests
        composite every other translucent token. Result: #27292e on the dark

#  APP SELECTOR DIALOG — unified with the Dev Hub pattern
# ============================================================
class SoftwareCatalogDialog(PulseDialog):
    """THE unified software hub — every installable app Pulse offers, in
    one scrollable list, filtered in place by a sub-category tab bar.

    This replaced AppSelectorDialog and DevHubSelectorDialog, which were
    two dialogs over four separate cards (Essential Apps, Dev Hub, Gaming,
    Diagnostics). That layout meant a user who wanted VLC, Docker and Steam
    ran three deploys from three places, and it gave "where do I get X?"
    four possible answers. One catalog, one deploy, one answer.

    THE TABS FILTER; THEY DO NOT PAGE. Every row is built once and merely
    hidden, so a tick survives a tab change and "Deploy Selected" can span
    sub-categories — which is the entire point of merging. It also means
    the selection counter is global while Select All / Deselect All are
    scoped to what is currently on screen: a "Select All" that silently
    ticked 43 rows across four hidden tabs would be a trap, and one that
    could not tick the 14 rows you are looking at would be useless.

    MANUAL-FIRST, unlike the old per-pack selector. Those dialogs arrived
    pre-checked because a card had already promised "the pack"; a 43-row
    catalog making the same promise would open with 43 apps queued and put
    the user to work untangling it. Nothing here is pre-ticked and the
    deploy button stays inert until something is actually chosen.

    ONE FILTER ROW, no quick-select bundles. The dialog used to carry a
    second strip of "Java / University Stack" / "AI / Python Stack" /
    "Web Dev Stack" buttons under the tabs. They were a THIRD way to
    narrow a list that already has two (tabs by category, field by name),

#  OFFICE WIZARD — step-by-step Office Deployment Tool flow
# ============================================================
class OfficeWizardDialog(PulseDialog):
    """Multi-path Office Deployment Tool (ODT) wizard.

    Office ships as one Click-to-Run bundle with no per-app silent
    installer, so unlike every other catalog item this can't be a single
    winget call. Three paths, chosen up front:

      A. Automated Cloud Download — Pulse fetches the Click-to-Run client
         itself and applies a built-in standard configuration. No files to
         find, no folders to browse. Sets `task_override` so the caller
         runs -Task InstallOfficeODTAuto instead of the per-file task.
      B. "I already have my files" — auto-detects Desktop\\Office (and the
         OneDrive-redirected / Public Desktop variants), with a folder
         browser and an individual-file-picker as fallbacks.
      C. Beginner Guide — a plain-language walkthrough for downloading the
         ODT and building a configuration.xml by hand via Microsoft's own
         tools, which then feeds into the same locate flow as B.

    All of this is client-side (file-system checks, QFileDialog, browser
    links — no PowerShell spawned yet). After Accepted, the caller reads
    either `task_override` (path A) or `setup_path`/`config_path` (path
    B/C) and runs it through the normal task pipeline — same live console,
    Stop button and toast machinery as every other task.

    download() + verify() half of the pipeline, on its own worker/thread
