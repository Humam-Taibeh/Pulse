.SYNOPSIS
    PULSE - Modular Enterprise Edition (v6.0)
    Windows Deployment & Optimization Framework - by Humam Taibeh
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    THIS FILE IS A THIN ORCHESTRATOR. All logic lives in the cohesive
    modules under .\modules\, dot-sourced below into ONE shared script
    scope (so every $Script:/$global: variable behaves exactly as it did
    in the pre-4.0 monolith).

    MODULE MAP (load order = numeric prefix):
      00-Foundation.ps1     logging, console UI, prompts, retry, registry
                            read helper, DRY-RUN primitives (-WhatIf engine)
      01-Catalogs.ps1       ALL data: tweaks, app/runtime catalogs, fallback
                            URLs, services, bloatware, dev-tool catalog
      02-Safety.ps1         restore points, tweak/service snapshots,
                            Edge/OneDrive backups, rollback, reset-all
      03-Environment.ps1    winget bootstrap, PATH management,
                            Verify-Environment (dev tools + system PATH scan)
      04-SoftwareEngine.ps1 Smart-Deploy, winget/choco engine, versions,
                            hardware matching, category processor
      05-Startup.ps1        startup program discovery + manager
      06-Tweaks.ps1         data-driven tweak engine + system tweaks,
                            network/power optimization, Edge/OneDrive removal
      07-Maintenance.ps1    SFC/DISM, cache clean, disks, services optimizer
      08-Privacy.ps1        bloatware, telemetry, advertising ID, activity
      09-SystemInfo.ps1     read-only system insight
      10-Office.ps1         Office Deployment Tool suite
      11-StateProbe.ps1     read-only "is this tweak applied?" probe
      12-HealthReport.ps1   read-only health + configuration-drift snapshot
      13-Activation.ps1     read-only Windows/Office licence status report
      20-Menus.ps1          the entire interactive console experience
      30-GuiDispatcher.ps1  Invoke-GuiTask - the PySide6 frontend contract

    INVOCATION MODES:
      core.ps1                      interactive luxury console menu (elevates)
      core.ps1 -Task <name>         GUI task mode: non-interactive, emits one
                                    final ##PULSE##SUCCESS|... or
                                    ##PULSE##ERROR|... verdict line
      core.ps1 -Task <n> -AppIds a,b   narrows a bulk deploy to ticked apps
      core.ps1 -Task StartupDisableItem -StartupItemId <id>
                                     toggles ONE startup entry (its own
                                     parameter, not -AppIds - the id may
                                     legitimately contain commas)
      core.ps1 -Task InstallOfficeODT -OfficeSetupPath <p> -OfficeConfigPath <p>
                                     runs the Office Deployment Tool wizard's
                                     resolved setup.exe / configuration.xml
      core.ps1 -Task InstallLocalFile -LocalInstallerPath <p>
                                     runs an installer the Tool Install
                                     Wizard's Path C pointed at
      core.ps1 [...] -WhatIf        DRY-RUN: full simulation, zero mutations

    CHANGELOG v4.0 (Modular Architecture Release):
      - Monolith decomposed into 13 single-responsibility modules; core.ps1
        is now only parameters + elevation + module loader + entry routing.
      - NEW Verify-Environment (task: VerifyEnvironment): audits Git, Python,
        Java, VS Code, GCC, Node and Ollama; auto-repairs missing user-PATH
        entries from known install roots and sets JAVA_HOME when resolvable.
        It also SCANS THE WHOLE SYSTEM PATH (both scopes, read from the
        registry) and reports dead and duplicate entries as [TAG] findings -
        reported only, never removed. See the header block in
        03-Environment.ps1 for why the two halves share one card.
      - NEW -WhatIf dry-run mode across every module: registry writes,
        service changes, deletions, installs and external tools are reported
        as "[WHATIF] ..." lines instead of executing; cache clean measures
        the space it would reclaim. GUI tasks report "[DRY-RUN]" results.
      - All v3.3/v3.4 contracts preserved verbatim: Invoke-GuiTask dispatcher
        (SUCCESS|/ERROR| final line), $Script:NonInteractive safety, tweak &
        service snapshotting, lazy winget bootstrap, data-driven catalogs.

#  SupportsShouldProcess, because the dry-run engine (Test-DryRun in
#  00-Foundation.ps1) must also govern external tools (winget, powercfg,
#  sfc, robocopy...) that ShouldProcess can never reach.

# path is <_MEIPASS>\VERSION, which is exactly where main.spec places it.
#
# The fallback is not defensive tidiness: $ErrorActionPreference is "Stop"

# a single module loaded — over a string used in a banner. Being
# approximately right about a version beats refusing to run.
