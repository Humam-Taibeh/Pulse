.SYNOPSIS
    15-Network.ps1 - per-adapter DNS profile switching (v1.0+ Phase 2, F4).

.DESCRIPTION
    Switching a PC to Cloudflare, Quad9 or AdGuard is one of the few
    single changes that improves speed AND privacy at once, and doing it
    by hand means five nested adapter dialogs per machine. This is that
    change, per adapter, with a real way back.

    THREE RULES THIS MODULE IS BUILT ON:

    1. REVERSIBLE, ALWAYS. Every profile below has a counterpart:
       Restore-PulseDnsDefaults resets the adapter to DHCP-provided DNS,
       which is the state Windows shipped in. A network tool that can
       strand a machine off the internet with no undo is not a tool, it
       is a hazard - so the undo is a first-class task with its own card,
       not a footnote.

    2. PER ADAPTER, NEVER "ALL". A laptop has Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and often
       a VPN or Hyper-V virtual switch. Rewriting DNS across all of them
       breaks the VPN's split-DNS and the virtual switch's host
       resolution, and the user asked to change ONE connection. The GUI
       picks the adapter; this module changes only what it is given.

    3. NOTHING IS RESOLVED HERE. The module writes addresses. It does not
       query them, test them, or phone anything to "verify" a profile -
       the DNS servers below are constants, published by their operators,
       and a privacy tool that made a network round trip to prove its
       privacy setting worked would be self-defeating.

    ADMIN IS REQUIRED and gated up front by the dispatcher: DNS
    configuration lives in the adapter's machine-scope settings.

# ============================================================
#  THE PROFILES
# ============================================================
# Published, documented resolver addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are set
# where the operator publishes them: leaving IPv6 pointed at the old
# resolver on a dual-stack machine means half the lookups quietly ignore
# the profile the user just chose - the failure mode that makes people
# think DNS changes "did nothing".
#
# `doh` is the operator's DNS-over-HTTPS template. Windows 11 (build
# 22000+) can encrypt queries to these resolvers; Windows 10 cannot, and
# Set-PulseDnsProfile reports that honestly rather than silently skipping.
