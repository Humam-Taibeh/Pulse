.SYNOPSIS
    30-GuiDispatcher.ps1 - the PySide6 frontend's task engine.

.DESCRIPTION
    CONTRACT (unchanged since v3.3 - the GUI's thread-safety logic in
    src/utils/helpers.py depends on it):
      - The frontend runs `core.ps1 -Task <name> [-AppIds a,b,c] [-WhatIf]`.
      - Every `task` in src/frontend/menu_structure.py maps 1:1 to one
        `switch ($TaskName)` case in Invoke-GuiTask below.
      - Invoke-GuiTask emits EXACTLY ONE final verdict line on stdout,
        prefixed with the ##PULSE## sentinel (v6.1) so no external tool's
        stray output can ever be mistaken for the verdict:
            ##PULSE##SUCCESS|Human readable message
            ##PULSE##ERROR|Human readable message
        Silence is the one failure mode we never allow: any unanticipated
        exception is converted to an ERROR verdict by the safety net.
        (The GUI scans backwards for the sentinel and still accepts bare
        SUCCESS|/ERROR| lines from pre-6.1 backends as a fallback.)
      - $Script:NonInteractive is $true for the whole run, so nothing below
        this layer ever blocks on Read-Host or pops UI.

    Under -WhatIf, successful mutating tasks report with a "[DRY-RUN]"
    prefix so the GUI/user can tell simulation from execution.
