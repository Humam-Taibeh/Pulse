.SYNOPSIS
    06-Tweaks.ps1 - the data-driven tweak engine plus every system tweak
    and optimization that mutates registry / power / network state.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Invoke-Tweak consumes $Script:TweakCatalog entries (01-Catalogs.ps1):
      a tweak is DATA (registry entries with On/Off values), never a bespoke
      function. Adding a tweak = adding a catalog entry.
    - Every change snapshots the original value first (02-Safety.ps1) and
      creates the once-per-session restore point.
    - All mutations flow through the dry-run primitives, so -WhatIf walks
      the exact same code paths and reports every write it would perform.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Cycles explorer.exe so File Explorer, the taskbar and the context
        menus rebuild against the current theme instead of the one they
        cached at sign-in. Returns $true when a live shell is running again.

    .DESCRIPTION
        THE SINGLE-INSTANCE TRAP, and why this is not just
        `Stop-Process -Name explorer -Force; Start-Process explorer`.
        Windows usually relaunches the shell by itself a moment after
        explorer.exe dies (that is what makes the desktop come back on its
        own). explorer.exe is also single-instance AS A SHELL: run it while a
        shell already owns the desktop and it does not become a second shell,
        it opens a FILE EXPLORER WINDOW. So the naive pair races - when the
        auto-restart wins, the user is left staring at a stray window of their
        Documents folder that they never asked for.

        So: kill, wait for the auto-restart, and only start a shell ourselves
        if none came back. That covers both machines - the ones that relaunch
        and the ones configured not to - and leaves no stray window on either.

        The relaunch is ANCHORED through Get-SystemBinary: this can run
        elevated, and a planted explorer.exe earlier in PATH would otherwise
        inherit that token. Same reasoning as Enable-ClassicContextMenu.

         1. Broadcast WM_SETTINGCHANGE('ImmersiveColorSet') so every top-level
            window re-reads the theme. This is what updates non-shell apps,
            which an Explorer restart does NOT touch - so it stays, and it
            goes first.
         2. ie4uinit.exe -show to refresh the shell's icon/theme caches.
         3. Restart explorer.exe (v10.3). Steps 1-2 alone were the previous
            behaviour, and they left real stale surfaces behind: the taskbar
            keeps its old acrylic tint, and Explorer's ribbon/nav pane and the
            Win11 context menus stay on the theme they were built with, because
            those surfaces resolve their brushes once at shell start and ignore
            ImmersiveColorSet. Cycling the shell is the only thing that clears
            them. It costs the user their open File Explorer windows, which is
            a real cost - hence Restart-ExplorerShell's care not to ALSO leave
            a stray window behind (see its note on the single-instance trap).

function Set-LiveMouseCurve {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Pushes the mouse acceleration triple into the RUNNING user session via
        SystemParametersInfo, so a pointer-precision change is felt on the very
        next mouse movement instead of at the next sign-in.

    .DESCRIPTION
        WHY THE REGISTRY IS NOT ENOUGH. HKCU:\Control Panel\Mouse is where
        Windows PERSISTS the pointer ballistics, but win32k reads that hive
        once, when the user session's input state is initialised. Writing the
        three values changed the stored setting and nothing about the live
        pointer, which is exactly the "it only applies after a reboot" report:
        the tweak was never wrong, it just was not being told to take effect.

        SPI_SETMOUSE is the one that matters. Its pvParam is an array of THREE
        ints - {xThreshold, yThreshold, acceleration} - which map to
        MouseThreshold1 / MouseThreshold2 / MouseSpeed respectively, and all
        zeroes is the documented "1:1, no ballistics" curve.

        SPI_SETMOUSESPEED is deliberately used to RE-STAMP the speed the user
        already has, read back through SPI_GETMOUSESPEED first, never to set a
        value of our own. Pointer SPEED (1-20) is a different setting from
        pointer ACCELERATION, and silently moving a user's sensitivity while
        they asked to disable acceleration would be a change they never
        requested. Re-applying the current value is still worth doing: it
        forces the ballistics table to be rebuilt, which is what makes some
        vendor mouse filter drivers honour the new curve without a re-plug.

        SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE | SPIF_SENDCHANGE persists the change through
        Windows' own path and broadcasts WM_SETTINGCHANGE, so Settings and
        Control Panel show the new state instead of a stale cached one.

        Best-effort by contract: returns $true/$false and never throws. The
        registry write is the durable half and has already happened by the time
        this runs, so a failure here costs the user immediacy, not the tweak.

        Pin the display and sleep timeouts to Never on AC power.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Ultimate/Pulse plan removes the CPU's power ceiling, but Windows
        still blanks the display and drops the machine to standby on the
        plan's inherited timeouts - so a workstation left to run a long
        build, render or transfer stalls anyway. Setting both to 0 (Never)
        is what makes the plan mean what its name promises.

        AC ONLY, deliberately. The -dc counterparts are left untouched: a
        machine on battery that never sleeps is a flat battery (and, in a
        bag, a hot one), which is also why the GUI marks this operation
        Desktop-PCs-only. Anything running on mains keeps its behaviour on
        mains and its safe defaults off it.

        Failures here are reported but NOT fatal to the caller: the power
        scheme itself is already active by this point, and a policy-managed
        machine can refuse the timeout change while allowing the plan.
