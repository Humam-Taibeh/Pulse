#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    01-Catalogs.ps1 - the single source of truth for ALL backend data.

.DESCRIPTION
    Data-driven design contract: adding an app, tweak, service, bloat package
    or developer tool = adding ONE entry here. No bespoke functions.

    Frontend mirror contract: the $Apps_* and $Runtimes arrays below MUST be
    mirrored exactly (same IDs, same order) by the `apps` lists in
    src/frontend/menu_structure.py - this file is the source of truth for
    what winget ID each entry installs; the GUI list is only its mirror.

    Contains zero functions and zero side effects - pure data.

#  UNIFIED SOFTWARE CATALOG (v1.0 RC)
#  THE flat list every GUI software install now deploys from - the single
#  hub behind menu_structure.py's SOFTWARE_CATALOG and the one
#  InstallCatalogApps dispatcher case.
#
#  Software Management used to spread installable apps across FOUR
#  separate cards (Essential Apps / Dev Hub / Gaming / Diagnostics) with
#  four dispatcher cases and four selector dialogs, so "where do I get
#  Docker" and "where do I get VLC" had different answers and nothing let
#  you pick one of each in a single pass. The GUI now shows one catalog
#  with a sub-category tab bar; the tabs are a VIEW over this list, not
#  four lists wearing a hat.
#
#  Order is load-bearing: it mirrors SOFTWARE_CATALOG's section order
#  (Browsers & Media -> Development & Tools -> Gaming Launchers ->
#  System Runtimes & Utilities) so the deploy log reads in the same order
#  the user saw on screen. The per-category arrays above are NOT dead -
#  console mode's App Deployment Hub (20-Menus.ps1) still walks them
#  category by category, which is the right shape for a numbered text
#  menu; only the GUI collapsed to one catalog.

# suite, a motherboard suite) used to ride along unconditionally with the
# Gaming and Diagnostics cards respectively. In a unified catalog they
# must stay tied to INTENT, not fire on every deploy: picking only VLC
# should not silently pull in an NVIDIA suite. InstallCatalogApps appends
# each extra only when the user's selection actually intersects the list

#  (only elevate), so this is a real, reachable failure - not a corner
#  case. Listing known offenders here lets Smart-Deploy skip the doomed

#  retry, both guaranteed to hit the same wall. Resolve-WingetExitCode in

#  elevationProhibited and hard-refuses under an Administrator token

#  $Script:WingetElevationConflictCodes in 04-SoftwareEngine.ps1) - so
#  requiring admin here made it permanently un-installable rather than
