.SYNOPSIS
    05-Startup.ps1 - startup program discovery, disable/re-enable and the
    interactive Startup Program Manager.

.DESCRIPTION
    Sources audited: HKCU/HKLM Run keys and the per-user/all-users Startup
    folders. Disabling is always reversible: registry entries are copied to
    HKCU:\Software\Pulse\DisabledStartup before removal, and
    shortcuts are MOVED to %LOCALAPPDATA%\PULSE\Backups\Startup, never deleted.
    Locations are defined in 01-Catalogs.ps1.

       counterpart the way -Path has -LiteralPath. Startup value names come
       from whatever an installer wrote, so a perfectly ordinary entry named
       "Acme Update [x64]" or "Sync*" would match — and DELETE — its
       siblings in the same Run key. Escaping is the only available fix. #>

# ============================================================
#  STARTUP OPTIMIZER — recommendation engine (v6.3, safety-tiered in v10.3)
#
#  THREE TIERS, EVALUATED IN THIS ORDER:
#    1. PROTECTED  never recommended for disabling, whatever else matches
#    2. Disable    known boot-time offenders
#    3. Keep       recognised-but-harmless publishers
#  Anything unmatched falls through to 'Review'.
#
#  WHY A THIRD TIER EXISTS. Until v10.3 there were only two lists and the
#  DISABLE list was checked first, on the reasoning that a known heavy app
#  should not be shadowed by a coincidental keep-pattern match. That
#  ordering is right for the Disable-vs-Keep question and wrong for safety:
#  it means any pattern that accidentally matches a sound driver, an input
#  helper or a security agent recommends disabling it, and the keep rule
#  written specifically to protect that component never gets consulted. The
#  cost of the two mistakes is not symmetric — over-recommending a game
#  launcher wastes nothing, while telling a user to disable their audio
#  stack or their antivirus breaks the machine and can't be spotted from
#  the row's own wording. So the protected tier goes FIRST and is absolute,
#  and the Disable-before-Keep precedence is preserved below it, unchanged.
# ============================================================

# Components that must never be recommended for disabling. Deliberately
# broader than the old keep list: it now covers the whole audio stack
# (every common vendor HDA helper, not just Realtek), input and IME,
# pointing devices, accessibility, storage/RAID drivers and endpoint
# security. These still appear in the manager and can still be toggled by
# hand — this governs what Pulse RECOMMENDS and what "Optimize Startup"
# will touch in bulk, which is the part the user is trusting.
