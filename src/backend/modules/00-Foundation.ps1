#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    00-Foundation.ps1 - shared runtime foundation for PULSE.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-sourced FIRST by src/backend/core.ps1. Everything here lands in the
    single shared script scope of core.ps1, so every later module can use it.

    Provides:
      - OS detection ($Script:OSBuild / IsWin11 / OSCaption / WindowsEditionID)
      - Log path + Write-Log and the whole console output vocabulary
      - Interactive prompt primitives (Ask-User, Read-Choice, ...) that are
        HARD-GUARDED by $Script:NonInteractive: when core.ps1 is launched by
        the GUI with -Task, no console is attached, so these must never block
        on Read-Host or pop UI. That contract is enforced here, once.
      - Invoke-WithRetry, Test-OSSupport / Test-EditionSupport
      - Registry read helper (Get-RegValue)
      - DRY-RUN PRIMITIVES: Test-DryRun / Invoke-Mutation / Set-RegValue /
        Remove-RegValue / Remove-RegKey. Every module routes its system
        mutations through these so `core.ps1 -WhatIf` simulates a full run
        (logging "[WHATIF] ..." lines) without changing the machine.

    CONTRACT: no function in this file mutates system state except through
    the dry-run primitives at the bottom.

# PULSE RUNS ELEVATED, AND A BARE EXECUTABLE NAME IS A SEARCH, NOT A PATH.
#
# `Start-Process explorer` or `& winget` resolves the name through
# $env:PATH, and PATH is assembled from HKCU as well as HKLM - a registry
# hive the UNELEVATED user owns and can write freely. Anything that drops
# an "explorer.exe" into a directory sitting earlier in PATH than the real
# one gets it launched WITH PULSE'S ADMINISTRATOR TOKEN, from a script the
# user believes only touches Windows' own tools. Naming the absolute path
# deletes the search, and with it the substitution.
#
# Resolved from the environment rather than a literal "C:\Windows": the
# system drive is not guaranteed to be C:, and GetFolderPath reads the same
# value the loader itself uses. On a 32-bit host process 'System' correctly
# yields SysWOW64, which is where that process's stock tools genuinely are.

        Test-Path miss would restore the exact PATH search this function
        exists to remove, and would do it precisely on the machines whose
        System32 is already unusual. A genuinely absent stock tool is a
        broken Windows, and the caller's own error handling should say so
        rather than silently running whatever PATH offers instead.

        WQL quotes strings with ' and escapes with backslash, so a value

        is parsed as QUERY rather than as data - the WMI equivalent of SQL
        injection. Service and product names reach these filters from the
        registry and from the machine's own installed-software list, i.e.
        from places a caller does not control.

        Backslash MUST be escaped first: doing the quote first would then
        have its own escaping backslash escaped by the second pass, undoing
        it.

# ============================================================
#  USER-HIVE TARGETING  (v1.0 - the split-token problem)
# ============================================================
# HKCU: IS NOT "THE USER" - IT IS "WHOEVER OWNS THIS TOKEN".
#
# When a standard user elevates Pulse by typing a DIFFERENT account's
# administrator credentials into the UAC dialog - the "over the shoulder"
# flow, which is the normal case on managed and Enterprise machines, and on
# any home PC whose daily account is not itself an admin - the elevated
# process belongs to that administrator. HKCU: then resolves to the
# ADMINISTRATOR's hive, not the hive of the person sitting at the desktop.
#
# Every per-user tweak Pulse applies is an HKCU write: dark mode, mouse
# acceleration, taskbar layout, Game Mode, the advertising ID
# ($Script:TweakCatalog in 01-Catalogs.ps1). Under a split token all of them
# landed on a profile nobody was looking at.
#
# THE REASON THIS WAS INVISIBLE, AND WHY IT IS THE WORST KIND OF BUG:
# 11-StateProbe.ps1 reads the same HKCU:, so it read back exactly what had
# just been written and the card lit up "Applied". The rollback snapshots in
# 02-Safety.ps1 went to the administrator's hive too, so "Reset All Tweaks"
# had nothing to restore for the real user. The system reported complete,
# consistent success for work that had no effect on the machine the user saw.
#
# THE FIX: resolve the DESKTOP user's SID and rewrite HKCU: paths to that
# user's subtree of HKEY_USERS. Their hive is already loaded - they are
# signed in - so this needs no `reg load` and no impersonation. When the
# token and the desktop user are the same account (the common case: an admin
# elevating themselves, or an unelevated run) nothing is rewritten at all and
# this costs one cached comparison.

    .SYNOPSIS
        One [TAG] line for a SCANNER's output, aligned into a tag column.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The Write-Info / Write-Success / Write-Warn family writes PROSE:
        a check glyph, then a sentence explaining what happened. That is
        right for a task that does a handful of things and needs to say
        what each of them was.

        It is wrong for a REPORT, which is what PATH Doctor produces - a
        list of thirty-odd findings the user reads by scanning down the
        left edge for the ones that are not [OK]. Sentences make that
        impossible: every line starts with the same glyph and diverges only
        somewhere in the middle, so there is no column to scan.

        So a tag, padded to a fixed width, and the finding after it. The
        tag is the ONLY thing in the left column, which is what makes a
        run of [OK] lines something the eye can skip over and a [MISSING]
        something it lands on.

        Colour is chosen by tag rather than passed in, so the same finding
        can never be green in one caller and yellow in another.

        Every line still reaches the log verbatim - a scannable console
        must not cost a searchable transcript.

#  GUI STRUCTURED DATA CHANNEL (v6.3)
#  Companion to the ##PULSE##SUCCESS|/ERROR| verdict contract: a task that
#  needs to hand the GUI more than one human-readable line (the winget
#  update scan, the startup report) emits exactly one
#      ##PULSE##DATA|<json>

#  into TaskResult.data and never prints it to the live console.
# ============================================================

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Writes one ##PULSE## wire-protocol line straight to stdout.

    .DESCRIPTION
        [Console]::Out, NOT Write-Output, and the difference is not stylistic.
        Write-Output writes to the PIPELINE - so a payload emitted from inside
        a function becomes part of that function's RETURN VALUE instead of
        reaching the pipe. That is not hypothetical: the streamed update scan
        calls its callbacks from inside Invoke-DeepUpdateScan, and with
        Write-Output every STAGE and ITEM line was silently captured into the
        scan's own result object. The frontend saw none of them, and the
        function's return value quietly became an array of strings with the
        real hashtable buried at the end.

        Console.Out has no such coupling: it is the process's stdout, which is
        the pipe helpers.py reads, regardless of which call frame emits it.
        Flushed explicitly so a streamed line arrives while it is still news -
        the whole point of the incremental channels is latency.

    <# Emits $Data (any JSON-serializable object, typically an array of
       PSCustomObjects) as one ##PULSE##DATA| line. ConvertTo-Json on
       Windows PowerShell 5.1 silently unwraps a single-element array to a
       bare JSON object - re-wrapped defensively here so the frontend can
       always assume "array in, array out" without a special case. #>

# ============================================================
#  GUI INCREMENTAL CHANNEL (v10.3)
#  ##PULSE##ITEM|<json>   one result, the moment it is known
#  ##PULSE##STAGE|<text>  what the task is doing right now
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS. DATA is a single line emitted when a task has finished
#  assembling its whole payload, which is the right shape for a report and
#  the wrong shape for a scan. The update scan spends most of its time in
#  one long winget call, so the GUI sat on a shimmer bar for ~30 seconds
#  with nothing to show and no way to tell a slow scan from a hung one.
#
#  These two channels do not replace DATA - the scan still emits its
#  complete array at the end, so a caller that ignores streaming behaves
#  exactly as before. They are a progressive PREVIEW of that same payload:
#  every ITEM is an element the final DATA array will also contain, so the
#  frontend can render rows as they arrive and then reconcile against the
#  authoritative document without ever showing a row that later vanishes.
#
#  Both are payload lines: helpers.py routes them to their own signals and
#  keeps them out of the live console, exactly like DATA and META.
# ============================================================
function Write-GuiItem {
    <# Emits ONE result object as it is discovered. Never throws and never
       aborts the scan that produced it: a streamed preview row is a
       convenience, and losing one costs a few hundred milliseconds of
       progressive rendering, not a result - the final Write-GuiData payload
       still carries it. #>

       callers to put structure in it that belongs in ITEM. #>

# ============================================================
#  GUI STRUCTURED VERDICT METRICS (v10.3)
#  A THIRD channel, deliberately separate from ##PULSE##DATA|.
#
#  WHY NOT REUSE DATA: the frontend takes the LAST DATA line it sees, and
#  DATA already belongs to the task — ScanForUpdates returns its version
#  audit through it, StartupReport its startup inventory, GetTweakState its
#  applied-state map. Emitting a metrics envelope on the same channel after
#  the task's own payload would shadow it and silently break the Update
#  Center and the Startup Manager.
#
#  WHAT IT IS NOT: this is not a second opinion on success. The
#  ##PULSE##SUCCESS|/ERROR| verdict line remains the single source of
#  truth for whether a task passed — two competing outcome fields would
#  eventually disagree, and the one the GUI trusts must never be in doubt.
#  META carries measurements only: which task, how long, how much it did.
# ============================================================
function Write-GuiMeta {
    <# Emits one ##PULSE##META|<json> line of measurements about the task
       that just ran. Never throws: a metrics line that broke a task would
