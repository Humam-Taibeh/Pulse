tools/fetch_app_icons.py

BUILD-TIME asset fetcher for Software Management's brand logos.

Run this once (or when the catalog changes) to populate
assets/appicons/. Pulse itself NEVER touches the network: the app reads
only the files this script leaves behind, which is what keeps an
elevated, privacy-focused Windows utility from phoning out to draw its
own UI. See src/utils/appicons.py for the runtime half.

    python tools/fetch_app_icons.py            # fetch missing only
    python tools/fetch_app_icons.py --force    # re-fetch everything

SOURCE: Simple Icons (https://simpleicons.org), the standard brand-mark
set for exactly this problem. The SVG files are CC0; the marks themselves
remain their owners' trademarks and are used here nominatively — to
identify the software a row installs, which is the same basis every
package manager and app store relies on.

WHY A HAND-WRITTEN MAP AND NOT FUZZY MATCHING: a wrong logo is worse than
no logo. "Cursor" fuzzy-matches a mouse-cursor icon; "MSI" matches both
the hardware brand and the installer format. Every pairing below was
checked by eye against the Simple Icons index, and anything without an
authentic mark is mapped to None rather than to something that merely
looks close.

#:   Anysphere.Cursor / BlueStacks.BlueStacks / OpenWebUI.OpenWebUI
#:       Not in the Simple Icons set at all.
#:   CPUID.* / CrystalDewWorld.* / TechPowerUp.GPU-Z
#:       Small hardware utilities with no published brand mark in any
#:       open set. (Note the trap: the index DOES contain a "crystal"
#:       slug — it is the Crystal programming language, nothing to do with

# ============================================================
#  SECOND SOURCE: FULL-COLOUR OFFICIAL BRAND LOGOS
# ============================================================
#: winget AppId -> an Iconify icon id from a BRAND-LOGO collection.
#:
#: Simple Icons (above) is a monochrome SILHOUETTE set — one flat path per
#: brand, recoloured at paint time. It is excellent, and it is also why
#: Microsoft's marks are absent: Simple Icons removed every Microsoft
#: product logo under Microsoft's trademark policy.
#:
#: This map is the answer to that gap. It pulls from Iconify's brand-logo
#: collections — principally `logos` (SVG Logos by Gil Barbara, CC0, ~1861
#: marks) — which carry the REAL, FULL-COLOUR artwork: VS Code's blue
#: ribbon with its actual gradient, Edge's actual swirl. These are the
#: vendors' own marks, not renditions, and they render in their true
#: colours rather than as a recoloured silhouette (see `color: true` in
#: the manifest and _brand_pixmap in src/utils/appicons.py).
#:
#: THREE COLLECTIONS, all permissively licensed, tried in this order by
#: hand rather than by search:
#:
#:   logos          CC0-1.0, 1880 marks (Gil Barbara's SVG Logos)
#:   thesvg-color   MIT, 4847 marks (thesvg.org)
#:   devicon        MIT, 1036 marks
#:
#: The map below is what MOVED THE CATALOG from 2 real logos and 34
#: recoloured silhouettes to 36 real logos and 1 silhouette. A silhouette
#: is authentic in shape and wrong in everything else — Chrome as a flat
#: blue disc is not the mark anyone recognises — so a colour source is
#: preferred wherever one genuinely exists.
#:
#: WHAT IS STILL MISSING, and why nothing is invented to cover it:
#: BlueStacks, DirectX, CPU-Z, GPU-Z, HWMonitor and CrystalDiskInfo have
#: NO authentic mark in any open, licensed icon set. That was not assumed
#: — it was measured against the full Simple Icons index (~3300 marks),
#: the whole `logos` collection (1880), the two MIT sets above, and
#: Iconify's federated search across every collection it aggregates. Those
#: six fall through to the runtime's next tier: the app's OWN icon, read
#: from its own installed binary, which is the vendor's genuine artwork
#: and needs no redistribution at all. When the app is not installed they
#: reach the neutral glyph, which says "no logo available" honestly.
#:
#: THE TRAPS ARE CLOSE AND THE SEARCH FINDS THEM: "hwmonitor" returns
#: `campaignmonitor`, "crystaldiskinfo" returns `crystal` (the programming
#: language) and "epic games" returns `unrealengine` — a different Epic
#: product. Every pairing below was checked by eye for that reason.
#:
#: THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT ON, restated because it was tested: a WRONG
#: logo is worse than no logo, and an INVENTED one is worse than both.
#: Pulse ships no hand-drawn stand-ins. To bundle a mark for one of the
#: seven, drop a genuine `<AppId>.svg` into assets/appicons/ and add it
#: here — the loader already prefers a file on disk.
