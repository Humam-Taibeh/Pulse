"""
Confirm-on-close while a task is running (v10.2).

Closing mid-task used to cancel silently. For this app that is the wrong
default: the running operation may be halfway through an MSI install, a
driver export or an Edge purge, and "stopped halfway" is a materially
worse state than either finished or never started.

The interesting cases are the NEGATIVE ones — declining must leave the
window open AND the task untouched — because a half-honoured "no" is
worse than no prompt at all: the user would keep a window whose task had
already been killed.
