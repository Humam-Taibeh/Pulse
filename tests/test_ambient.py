"""
Ambient background performance contract.

The glow is the bottom widget in the shell, so it is repainted far more
often than its own ~28fps timer requests: every animation above it (the two
BreathingIcons) forces a partial repaint underneath. Measured at idle
before this was addressed: 3.55 paintEvents per timer tick, ~76/s, adding
up to 26 full-widget repaints per second at ~2.7ms each.

The fix is not to paint less often — that is not ours to control — but to
make each paint cheap: the three drifting orbs are composited into one
cached pixmap and blitted, instead of three smooth-scaled blits per frame.
