.SYNOPSIS
    Pester coverage for the v10.3 Update Center scan (04-SoftwareEngine.ps1)
    and the startup optimizer's safety tier (05-Startup.ps1).

.DESCRIPTION
    THE WINGET TABLE PARSER. `winget upgrade` prints TWO tables, not one:
    the main list, then "The following packages have an upgrade available,
    but require explicit targeting for upgrade:" followed by a second table
    with its OWN column widths, because winget re-measures them per table.
    The parser locked onto the first header and sliced every later line at
    those offsets, which had two consequences on a real machine:

      * the packages in the second table were mangled or lost outright, and
      * the introducing SENTENCE was itself sliced into a phantom package.
        That reached the Update Center as a checkable row reading
        "The following packages have an upgrade avail" -> "r upgrade:",
        which the user could tick and try to install.

    Both are reproduced verbatim below from captured winget output.

    THE SAFETY TIER. Until v10.3 the recommendation engine checked its
    DISABLE patterns before its keep patterns. Any disable pattern that
    happened to match an audio helper, an input driver or a security agent
    therefore recommended disabling it, and the keep rule written
    specifically to protect that component was never consulted. The two
    mistakes do not cost the same: over-recommending a game launcher wastes
    nothing, while telling someone to disable their audio stack breaks the
    machine in a way the row's own wording gives no hint of.
