"""
Navigation and engine performance contract.

The defect these pin down was reported as "switching between the four
modules feels laggy, heavy, like the app is freezing", and it was two
independent things wearing one symptom.

1. THE SWITCH WAS NOT SLOW — THE ENTRANCE WAS. Every page is built up
   front and lives in the QStackedWidget, so raising one measured 1.7 ms
   warm. What followed it was a per-card staggered cascade whose length
   was `card_index * CASCADE_GAP`: unbounded in page density, so the
   14-card module took 508 ms to finish assembling itself, EVERY visit,
   including the tenth. Measured end to end, warm, round-robin over all
   four modules: 399.8 ms mean / 523.7 ms worst before, 31.9 / 34.8 after.

2. THE AMBIENT WASH WAS SATURATING THE GUI THREAD. AmbientGlow is the
   bottom widget in the shell and everything above it is translucent by
   design, so its update() dirties the whole window and Qt repaints every
   card, panel and chrome element on top of it: 18.5 ms a frame, of which
   the glow's own paint is 2.7. At the old 36 ms interval that blocked the
   main thread 46.2% of wall time at idle, in blocks of up to 31 ms —
   which is what every click, including a nav click, had to queue behind.

Both are the kind of regression that reads as "the machine is slow"
rather than as a bug, so the contracts are asserted here rather than left
to be noticed.
