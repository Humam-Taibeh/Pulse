Visual finish contracts — the v1.1 cosmetic polish pass.

Every assertion here replaced something that was found by MEASURING the
running app rather than by looking at it, which is the same standard the
layout and palette suites hold:

  * the card status badges tinted themselves in their own hue, the exact
    "badge-tint trap" strip_status_qss documents and avoids, and it cost
    them AA — 4.02:1 in light mode on a state-tinted card, on the smallest
    type in the product;
  * the masthead tagline did not elide, it CLIPPED, losing 40px mid-glyph
    at the app's own 980px minimum window width;
  * ElidedCaption measured its size hint off the text it had already
    elided, so the first squeeze was permanent — a ratchet;
  * four input fields had drifted to three different hover weights and the
    most-used one (Ctrl+K) had no hover state at all;
  * console_qss carried a byte-for-byte copy of the shared scrollbar rules.

None of these raises. All of them are invisible until somebody renders the
exact combination that exposes them.

        Note what this does NOT do: pre-`resize()` the dialog to the host
        before showing it. Every other test in this class does, and that is
        exactly why none of them caught this — pre-sizing makes the
        construction-time geometry equal to the post-refit geometry, so the
        capture happens to be taken for the right rectangle and the race
        disappears. Opened the way the app actually opens one, a PulseDialog
        is still its construction size in showEvent, and refit_dialog
        expands it to the host's whole body only afterwards.

        Capturing before that ran produced a frost sized and offset for the
        wrong rectangle, which paintEvent then stretched across the full
        backdrop — a flat hard-edged block with the real content smeared and
        misregistered around it. It corrected itself when the 120ms refrost
        timer fired, so it was invisible to a late screenshot and glaring
        during the entrance, especially on a slow machine where the broken
        frame simply stays up longer.

        Asserting the frost is registered to the FINAL geometry is what
        pins it: a stale-geometry capture cannot satisfy this.
