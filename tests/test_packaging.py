"""
The release pipeline: spec -> bundle -> installer -> checksums.

None of this runs PyInstaller or Inno Setup — that takes minutes and needs
both installed. What it pins is the set of facts the artifacts depend on,
each of which has a failure that only appears in a shipped build:

    a onefile regression      -> seconds of cold start, engine in %TEMP%
    a changed AppId           -> upgrades install a second copy
    a drifting version        -> the updater compares against the wrong thing
    a renamed installer       -> every release silently has "no installer"
    a dropped SHA256SUMS      -> the updater declines every update
