    #: (text token, surface token, floor). Body copy is held to WCAG AA
    #: (4.5:1); the muted and faint tiers are captions and secondary
    #: labels at a larger effective weight, so they are held to the 3:1
    #: large-text floor. Below those numbers the light theme washes out —
    #: which is exactly how the v10 palette shipped, at 1.86-2.64:1.
    _CONTRAST_PAIRS = [
        ("text",       "dialog_bg", 4.5),
        ("text",       "card",      4.5),

    #: (surface, surface, floor). SEPARATE from the text pairs above, and
    #: added because their absence hid a real defect: every pair above
    #: passed while a card measured 1.12:1 (light) and 1.11:1 (dark)
    #: against the well it sits in — text was legible ON the card, and the
    #: card itself did not read as a surface at all. Body copy and
    #: elevation are two different questions and only one of them was
    #: being asked.
    #:
    #: The floors are LOW on purpose, and are not WCAG numbers. WCAG 1.4.11
    #: asks 3:1 of a UI boundary, which neither theme can reach without
    #: abandoning its register — a white-on-grey macOS light mode and a
    #: jet-obsidian dark mode both separate their surfaces by a whisker of
    #: luminance plus a hairline. These are regression floors: they pin the
    #: separation the palette was deliberately solved to, so a future edit
    #: that flattens a card back into its well fails loudly instead of
    #: shipping. Each sits just under its measured value.
    #:
    #: v14 RE-SOLVES THEM DOWN (1.25 -> 1.05), and the reason is that the
    #: JOB MOVED rather than that the bar was inconvenient. Through v13 the
    #: content well RECESSED below the canvas and the card had to
    #: out-brighten it, so tone was doing the lifting and 1.25 was a fair
    #: description of it. The obsidian/clean-minimal palette gives that up
    #: on purpose: both modes now run canvas -> raised container -> card,
    #: each a whisper apart, and hand elevation to the hairline and the cast
    #: shadow instead (see theme.card_line, theme.shadow_alphas, and
    #: test_elevation, which measures both).
    #:
    #: 1.25 IS NOT REACHABLE AT THESE SURFACES — it is arithmetically out of
    #: range, not merely missed. WCAG's ratio is (Lhi+0.05)/(Llo+0.05), and
    #: down at obsidian luminances the +0.05 floor dominates both terms:
    #: #181A1F measures 1.218:1 against PURE BLACK, so no choice of well can
    #: buy 1.25 while the card stays the colour the redesign specifies.
    #: Light is the mirror image — #FFFFFF on the #F3F4F6 canvas is 1.113:1
    #: and the canvas cannot be darkened without breaking the filter chip
    #: (see the note on _LIGHT's bg_solid). Measured today: dark 1.060,
    #: light 1.101. The floor sits just under the pair.
    #:
    #: `dialog_bg` is deliberately ABSENT. A dialog never sits on the
    #: content well — PulseDialog covers the body with a dense scrim and
    #: centres the panel on that, so its separation is from the scrim, and
    #: measuring it against the well pins a relationship no one ever sees.

        """THE CALM CONTRACT (v12.1).

        Contrast and peer parity were both already pinned, and the palette
        still shipped five tokens at 100% HSL saturation — because nothing
        constrained CHROMA. Contrast can be satisfied at any saturation, so
        a solve that only chases ratios has no reason not to drift loud,
        and this one did: OKLCh chroma spanned 39.6% to 90.2% across the
        set, which is why a few modules shouted while the rest whispered.

        This is the missing constraint, and it has to exist SEPARATELY
        because the failure it catches is invisible to every other test in
        this file. The v12.1 re-solve moved chroma at FIXED LUMINANCE
        precisely so no ratio changed — which means the reverse edit would
        also hold every ratio, keep peer parity, keep dE, and pass the
        whole suite while walking the palette straight back to neon.
