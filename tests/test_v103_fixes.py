v10.3 regression contracts — the batch of fixes that shipped with the
Update Center overhaul.

Every assertion here corresponds to a defect that was REPRODUCED before it
was fixed, either by rendering the running app and reading pixels or by
running the real backend and reading its stdout. None of them raises on its
own, and four of the six were invisible in code review:

  * the accent hairline was drawn on a rect inset by 0.5px at the SAME
    corner radius as the card boundary, so it was concentric on the four
    straight runs and drifted 0.207px inward at the 45 degree point of every
    corner — far too little to see as a misplaced line and exactly enough
    for antialiasing to resolve it as a second edge. That is the "double
    edge corner" the card grid had on hover;

  * StatusDot was the one QLabel in the app that never received a
    stylesheet, so it inherited WA_StyledBackground from an ancestor's QSS
    and Qt filled its rect with the palette Window brush before paintEvent
    ran. The label stretches to the rail's full height, so a 12px dot was
    standing in front of an opaque 12x42 slab;

  * ##PULSE##ITEM| / ##PULSE##STAGE| had to be registered as PAYLOAD
    prefixes, not just parsed. A payload line that is not in that tuple is
    eligible to be read as the task's verdict by the backwards scan, and it
    also gets printed verbatim into the live console;

  * the startup recommendation engine checked its DISABLE patterns before
    its keep patterns, so any disable pattern that happened to match an
    audio helper or a security agent recommended disabling it and the keep
    rule written to protect that component was never consulted.
