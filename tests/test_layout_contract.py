Layout & dialog standards — the v1.0+ Phase 0 guards.

These encode the visual standards that previously existed only as
convention, and each one is here because the thing it forbids ALREADY
SHIPPED once and was found by measuring rather than by looking:

  * a dialog whose content floor exceeded the window it opens in (the
    Software Catalog's 5-tab row forced a 1637px panel against a 1100px
    cap, so the panel was wider than the app at every window size);
  * a sparse row of "matching" tiles that were not the same width, because
    the shared column width was measured off the wrong size hint;
  * a section band whose header outlived its own cards under a filter, so
    the title sat over the next band's content and mislabelled it.

None of these raises. All three are invisible until somebody renders the
exact combination that exposes them, which is what makes them worth
pinning.
