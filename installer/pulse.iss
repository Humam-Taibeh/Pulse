;  Builds PULSE_Setup_v<VERSION>.exe from the onedir PyInstaller output
;  in dist\PULSE\.
;
;  Not invoked directly — tools\build_release.ps1 defines MyAppVersion
;  from the repo's VERSION file and calls iscc. Compiling this by hand
;  works too; it just falls back to reading VERSION itself.

;  Build:  iscc installer\pulse.iss
;  Out:    dist\PULSE_Setup_v10.4.0.exe

#ifndef MyAppVersion
  ; Read the same VERSION file the GUI, the engine and the spec read, so a
  ; hand-run compile cannot stamp a different version than the build script
  ; would have. #include is the only way to get a file's contents into a
  ; preprocessor variable, hence the temporary define.

;  INSTALL LOCATION AND PRIVILEGE
; ------------------------------------------------------------
; ADMIN / PROGRAM FILES BY DEFAULT, and this is a security decision rather
; than a convention. PULSE runs asInvoked and elevates per task (~24 of
; them touch HKLM, services or machine state). If the application lived in
; a user-writable directory, any process running as the user could replace
; PULSE.exe or the PowerShell engine beside it and wait for the next
; elevated task to run it — a straight privilege-escalation path. Program
; Files is not writable without elevation, which closes it.
;
; This is the same boundary src/utils/resources.py defends when it refuses
; to resolve core.ps1 from the executable's own directory, and the reason
; the PyInstaller spec moved off onefile (%TEMP% extraction).
;
; A per-user install remains available for machines where the technician
; has no admin rights — Inno offers the choice when this override is set —
; but it is not the default, and the elevated-task caveat above applies to
; anyone who picks it.

; The auto-updater (src/utils/updater.py) downloads this installer and runs

; uncomment these; the updater's Authenticode check (see updater.verify)
; starts enforcing a publisher match at the same moment.

{ ------------------------------------------------------------
  Uninstall: offer to remove preferences, never assume.

  prefs.py stores theme, window geometry and per-task run history under
  HKCU\Software\HumamTaibeh\Pulse. Two things must both stay true:

    * An UPGRADE must never touch it. Inno runs the old uninstaller during
      some upgrade paths, and silently wiping a user's history and window
      placement on a version bump would be a bug they could not explain.
      Hence UninstallSilent() — an upgrade-driven uninstall is silent, an
      interactive one is not.

    * A deliberate REMOVAL should be able to leave nothing behind, but that
      is the user's call. Someone uninstalling to reinstall a fixed build
      does not want to lose a year of task history.
